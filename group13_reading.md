## 📖 Reading Passage: The Right Path

Michael stood **between** two paths, **unable** to **decide** **which** way to go. **Both** paths looked **similar**, yet **different** **enough** to **matter**. This **wasn** wasn't just about choosing a hiking trail – it was a **metaphor** for the **major** **decision** he faced in **real** **life**.

He had **received** two job **offers**. **Both** were **good** opportunities, but they would **lead** him in **very** **different** **directions**. One was **with** a **large** **company** in the **city**, **offering** **high** **pay** and **prestige**. The other was **with** a **small** **non**-profit **organization**, **doing** **work** he **believed** in but **with** **much** **less** **money**.

"**Which** one should I **choose**?" he had **asked** his **mentor**, Dr. **Williams**, **during** their **last** **meeting**.

"That's something **only** you can **decide**," Dr. **Williams** replied. "**Both** options have **merit**. The **question** is: **which** **path** **aligns** **with** **who** you **are** and **who** you **want** to **become**?"

Michael **thought** about this as he **stood** **between** the two trails. **Which** **path** would bring him **more** **satisfaction**? **Which** would he **regret** **less** if he looked **back** years **later**?

He **decided** to **walk** **between** the paths for a **while**, **thinking**. The **forest** was **quiet**, **peaceful**. **Both** paths had **their** **own** **beauty**. **Both** seemed to **lead** somewhere **interesting**. But he could **only** **choose** one.

**Which** **decision** was **right**? Michael **realized** there might not be a "**right**" **answer**. **Both** choices could **lead** to **good** **outcomes**. The **real** **question** was **which** **path** **felt** **more** **authentic** to him.

He **pulled** out his **phone** and **called** his **sister**, **Lisa**. "I'm **still** **torn** **between** the two jobs," he **admitted**.

"**Which** one **makes** you **feel** **more** **excited**?" **Lisa** **asked**.

Michael **paused**. **Which** one **did** **excite** him **more**? The **corporate** job was **impressive** – **both** his **parents** would be **proud**. But the **non**-profit job...that was **where** his **heart** **pulled** him.

"I **think** I **know** **which** one I **want**," Michael **said** **slowly**. "But I'm **worried** about **making** the **wrong** **choice**."

"There's no **wrong** **choice** **between** two **good** **options**," **Lisa** **said**. "**Both** will **teach** you **something**. **Both** will **take** you somewhere. The **question** is **which** **journey** do you **want** to **experience**?"

**After** hanging up, Michael **sat** down **between** the two paths. He **thought** about **what** **mattered** **most** to him. **Money** was **important** – he **couldn't** **deny** that. But **meaning** was **important** **too**. **Which** would he **value** **more** in **five** years?

He **remembered** **something** Dr. **Williams** had **said**: "**Between** **money** and **meaning**, **most** **people** **choose** **money** **when** they're **young**. **Then** they **spend** **the** **rest** of **their** **lives** **wondering** **which** **path** would have **been** **better** if they'd **chosen** **differently**."

Michael **didn't** **want** to **live** **with** that **regret**. He **wanted** to **choose** **based** on **which** **path** **aligned** **with** his **values**, not **which** one **looked** **better** on **paper**.

He **stood** up and **chose** the **left** **path** – the one that **led** **deeper** into the **forest**. It was **less** **traveled**, **more** **uncertain**, but it **felt** **right**. **Which** was **interesting**, **because** the **less** **traveled** **path** was **like** the **non**-profit job: **less** **conventional**, **less** **secure**, but **more** **aligned** **with** **who** he was.

As he **walked**, Michael **felt** a **sense** of **peace**. He had **made** his **decision**. He **would** **take** the **non**-profit job. **Both** options were **good**, but this was the one that **felt** **authentic** to him.

**Which** **path** was **right**? The one you **choose** **with** **conviction**. The one **between** **which** and **doubt**, you **pick** **which** **without** **regret**.

Michael **smiled**. **Both** jobs had **been** **tempting**, but now he **knew** **which** one was **his** **path**. And that was all that **mattered**.
