## Reading Passage

### The Artist's Second Chance

The **blast** of cold winter wind hit Marcus as he stepped out of the **courtroom**. The judge had **verified** his identity as a reformed **offender**, someone who had paid his debt to society. Five years ago, he had been part of a **corrupt** system that dealt in **propaganda** and lies. Now, standing in **downtown** Boston with nothing but a small **canvas** bag and a heart full of **appreciation**, he was ready to **strive** for a better life.

"**Aah**, **heck**," Marcus muttered to himself, pulling his worn jacket tighter. The **steep** steps of the courthouse felt like a mountain. He had no **fancy** plans, no **magical** solutions. But he did have **compassion** for others and a **loyal** friend waiting at a café around the **counter**.

Sarah, his **parental** figure who had **inherited** the role when his own parents gave up on him, sat at a corner table. She was a **collector** of lost souls, people would say. As a **solo** artist who painted on **canvas**, she had taught Marcus to see beauty even in **disappointment**. Her **listener** skills were **ideal**—she never judged, only encouraged.

"Marcus!" She jumped up **happily**, her coffee almost tipping over. "You made it! How were the **proceedings**?"

"**Brutal**," he admitted, taking a seat. "The **public** doesn't forget easily. The **irony** is that I spent three years helping expose the very **corruption** I was once part of. Some people still look at me with **spite**, no matter what I do."

Sarah reached across and gave his hand a gentle **punch**. "**Despite** all that, you're here. That's what matters. Now, let me tell you about an opportunity." She pulled out a flyer from her **drawer**-sized purse. "The **disabled** children's center needs an art teacher. It's just a **chunk** of change for now, but it's honest work."

Marcus felt his throat tighten. "After everything I've done, working with kids?"

"Especially after everything you've done," Sarah said firmly. "You know what it's like to **scratch** and claw your way back. These children **desperately** need someone who understands struggle."

The **short-term** contract started the next Monday. The center was a modest building with **ash**-colored walls that desperately needed **painting**. Marcus met Director Chen, a woman preparing for **re-election** to the board, who explained the **projection** for the program's growth.

"We're not looking for someone who's perfect," she said. "We need someone real, someone who can connect **socially** with these children. Many have had **developmental** challenges, and art helps them express what words cannot."

The first class was chaotic. Twelve children, ages seven to twelve, stared at him with curious eyes. Marcus decided to be honest. "I'm Mr. Marcus, and I'm here to help you create. But first, I want to **verify** something with you all—do you believe everyone deserves a second chance?"

Hands shot up. One girl named Emma, who used a wheelchair, spoke first. "My mom says everyone makes mistakes. Even my **Dutch** grandma, who never makes mistakes, once put salt instead of sugar in her **soda** cake!"

The room erupted in laughter. Marcus felt something shift inside him. "You're absolutely right, Emma. Now, let's make some art that would make your grandma proud—even if she used salt!"

Over the next three months, Marcus transformed. He taught the children to **punch** colors onto **canvas**, to **scratch** designs into clay, to see their **disabilities** not as limitations but as unique perspectives. He worked **desperately** to prove himself, arriving early, staying late, and putting in effort that went beyond his **short-term** contract.

One afternoon, Emma created a painting of a **throne** made entirely of paintbrushes. "It's for you, Mr. Marcus," she said. "Because you're the king of second chances."

Marcus had to **step** outside, overcome with emotion. Sarah found him wiping his eyes. "Quite the **comic** scene, tough guy," she teased. "Who knew you'd become so **socially** connected?"

"I never thought I'd find this kind of **appreciation** for simple work," Marcus said. "No **propaganda**, no **corruption**. Just honest teaching and genuine **compassion**."

"That's the **ideal** life," Sarah agreed. "And speaking of which, Director Chen wants to offer you a permanent position. Plus, the **public** relations officer mentioned you in their newsletter. Your story is helping with **fundraising**."

The **irony** wasn't lost on Marcus. He had once created false **projections** and **corrupt** reports. Now, his genuine transformation was **aiding** a cause that mattered. The center even featured his **students'** work in a **downtown** gallery, giving **disabled** artists the recognition they deserved.

At the exhibition opening, Marcus stood before a **canvas** covered with handprints of all his students. "This represents every hand that gave me a second chance," he told the **listener**s. "Sarah, who showed **parental** love when I had none. Director Chen, who looked past my record. And most importantly, these children, who taught me that **loyalty** to yourself means **striving** to be better every single day."

The crowd clapped, but it wasn't the applause that moved him. It was Emma in her wheelchair, giving him a thumbs up, her face showing pure joy. She had created a **comic** book series about a reformed **offender** who becomes a superhero—clearly inspired by their conversations.

"**Despite** the **brutal** past," Marcus said in his closing speech, "I've learned that **compassion** can **whip** through the coldest **blast** of judgment. Every **chunk** of **disappointment** can become a building block. Every **stamp** of 'criminal' can be rewritten with the **magical** power of genuine change and **parental** community support."

As the evening ended, Marcus helped **pack** up the artwork. He noticed a **drawer** in the gallery's **counter** had been left open, filled with comment cards. **Curious**, he read a few. "**Inspiring**." "**Beautiful** work from **beautiful** souls." "This **artist** deserves support for his **re-election** to **humanity**—if there were such a **vote**!"

Sarah appeared at his side, two cups of **soda** in hand. "So, Mr. Permanent Art Teacher, how does it feel?"

Marcus smiled, a genuine **expression** that transformed his face. "It feels like I've **inherited** the best possible life. Not through **theft** or **corruption**, but through **striving** and honest work. These kids **punch** through **every** **stereotype** about **disability**. They've taught me that **despite** our **scratches** and **bruises**, we can all create something **magical**."

"That's quite the **projection** for the future," Sarah said with a **grin**.

"No **projection**," Marcus corrected. "This is **reality**. And I'm going to be **loyal** to this path **desperately**, **happily**, and with complete **dedication**."

The **courtroom** proceedings felt like a lifetime ago. Marcus had **verified** something important: a person isn't defined by their **worst** moments but by how they **strive** to **overcome** them. His **throne** wasn't made of power or **wealth**, but of **canvas**, **paint**, and the **laughter** of children who **believed** in **second** chances.

As they walked through **downtown** under **streetlights**, Marcus felt truly free. The **steep** journey wasn't over—he knew that. But with **compassion**, **loyalty**, and a commitment to **aid** others, he had found his **ideal** life. The **blast** of winter wind no longer felt cold; it felt refreshing, like a **clean** start.

And in that moment, Marcus understood the ultimate **irony**: by helping others find their **voice** through art, he had finally found his own.

## Chinese Translation

### 艺术家的第二次机会

当马库斯走出法庭时,寒冬的冷风猛烈地吹来。法官已经核实了他作为一名改过自新的罪犯的身份,一个已经偿还了社会债务的人。五年前,他曾是一个腐败系统的一部分,从事宣传和谎言的交易。现在,站在波士顿市中心,除了一个装着帆布的小包和一颗充满感激的心,他已经准备好为更好的生活而奋斗。

"啊,见鬼,"马库斯对自己嘀咕着,把他破旧的夹克裹得更紧。法院陡峭的台阶感觉像一座山。他没有华丽的计划,没有神奇的解决方案。但他确实对他人有同情心,还有一个忠诚的朋友在柜台附近的咖啡馆等着他。

莎拉,当他自己的父母放弃他时,她继承了父母般的角色,坐在角落的桌子旁。人们会说她是一个失落灵魂的收藏家。作为一名在画布上作画的独奏艺术家,她教会了马库斯即使在失望中也能看到美。她作为倾听者的技能是理想的——她从不评判,只是鼓励。

"马库斯!"她高兴地跳起来,咖啡差点打翻。"你成功了!诉讼程序怎么样?"

"残酷,"他承认,坐下来。"公众不会轻易忘记。讽刺的是,我花了三年时间帮助揭露我曾经参与的腐败。有些人仍然带着恶意看着我,无论我做什么。"

莎拉伸手轻轻地打了一下他的手。"尽管如此,你还是来了。这才是最重要的。现在,让我告诉你一个机会。"她从她抽屉大小的钱包里拿出一张传单。"残疾儿童中心需要一名美术老师。现在只是一小笔钱,但这是诚实的工作。"

马库斯感到喉咙发紧。"在我做了这一切之后,和孩子们一起工作?"

"正是因为你经历了这一切,"莎拉坚定地说。"你知道拼命挣扎着爬回来是什么感觉。这些孩子迫切需要一个理解挣扎的人。"

短期合同从下周一开始。中心是一座朴素的建筑,灰色的墙壁迫切需要粉刷。马库斯见到了陈主任,一位准备连任董事会的女士,她解释了该项目增长的预测。

"我们不是在寻找完美的人,"她说。"我们需要一个真实的人,一个能够在社交上与这些孩子建立联系的人。许多人有发展方面的挑战,艺术帮助他们表达语言无法表达的东西。"

第一堂课很混乱。十二个孩子,年龄在七到十二岁之间,用好奇的眼睛盯着他。马库斯决定诚实。"我是马库斯老师,我来这里帮助你们创作。但首先,我想和你们所有人核实一件事——你们相信每个人都应该有第二次机会吗?"

手举了起来。一个叫艾玛的女孩,坐着轮椅,第一个发言。"我妈妈说每个人都会犯错。即使是我从不犯错的荷兰奶奶,有一次也把盐当糖放进了她的苏打蛋糕里!"

房间里爆发出笑声。马库斯感到内心有些东西在转变。"你说得完全正确,艾玛。现在,让我们创作一些能让你奶奶骄傲的艺术作品——即使她用了盐!"

在接下来的三个月里,马库斯发生了转变。他教孩子们在画布上打上颜色,在粘土上刮出图案,把他们的残疾看作不是限制而是独特的视角。他拼命地努力证明自己,早到晚退,付出的努力远远超出了他的短期合同。

一天下午,艾玛创作了一幅完全由画笔制成的王座画。"这是给你的,马库斯老师,"她说。"因为你是第二次机会之王。"

马库斯不得不走到外面,被情绪压倒。莎拉发现他在擦眼睛。"真是一个滑稽的场景,硬汉,"她取笑道。"谁知道你会变得如此善于社交?"

"我从没想过我会对简单的工作有这种感激之情,"马库斯说。"没有宣传,没有腐败。只有诚实的教学和真诚的同情。"

"那就是理想的生活,"莎拉同意道。"说到这个,陈主任想给你提供一个永久职位。另外,公共关系官员在他们的通讯中提到了你。你的故事正在帮助筹款。"

马库斯没有错过这个讽刺。他曾经制造过虚假的预测和腐败的报告。现在,他真正的转变正在帮助一个重要的事业。中心甚至在市中心的画廊展示了他学生的作品,给予残疾艺术家应有的认可。

在展览开幕式上,马库斯站在一块覆盖着所有学生手印的画布前。"这代表了每一只给我第二次机会的手,"他告诉听众。"莎拉,在我一无所有时展现了父母般的爱。陈主任,她不计我的记录。最重要的是,这些孩子,他们教会我,对自己的忠诚意味着每天都努力变得更好。"

人群鼓掌,但打动他的不是掌声。而是坐在轮椅上的艾玛,给他竖起大拇指,她的脸上露出纯粹的喜悦。她创作了一系列关于一个改过自新的罪犯成为超级英雄的漫画书——显然受到了他们对话的启发。

"尽管过去很残酷,"马库斯在闭幕演讲中说,"我学到了同情可以鞭打过最冷的判断风暴。每一块失望都可以成为基石。每一个'罪犯'的印记都可以用真正改变的神奇力量和父母般的社区支持重新书写。"

当晚结束时,马库斯帮忙收拾艺术品。他注意到画廊柜台的一个抽屉开着,里面装满了评论卡。出于好奇,他读了几张。"鼓舞人心。""美丽灵魂的美丽作品。""这位艺术家值得支持他连任人性——如果有这样的投票的话!"

莎拉出现在他身边,手里拿着两杯苏打水。"那么,永久美术老师先生,感觉如何?"

马库斯微笑着,一个真诚的表情改变了他的脸。"感觉就像我继承了最好的生活。不是通过偷窃或腐败,而是通过奋斗和诚实的工作。这些孩子打破了关于残疾的每一个刻板印象。他们教会我,尽管我们有伤痕和瘀伤,我们都可以创造一些神奇的东西。"

"那是对未来的一个很好的预测,"莎拉笑着说。

"不是预测,"马库斯纠正道。"这是现实。我将拼命地、快乐地、完全献身地忠于这条道路。"

法庭诉讼程序感觉像是一辈子以前的事了。马库斯核实了一些重要的事情:一个人不是由他们最糟糕的时刻定义的,而是由他们如何努力克服这些时刻定义的。他的王座不是由权力或财富构成的,而是由画布、颜料和相信第二次机会的孩子们的笑声构成的。

当他们在路灯下穿过市中心时,马库斯感到真正的自由。陡峭的旅程还没有结束——他知道这一点。但有了同情、忠诚和帮助他人的承诺,他找到了理想的生活。冬天的冷风不再感到寒冷;它感觉清爽,就像一个全新的开始。

在那一刻,马库斯理解了终极的讽刺:通过帮助别人通过艺术找到他们的声音,他终于找到了自己的声音。

Link vocabulary to the main narrative: Remember "offender" and "courtroom" together with Marcus's journey from crime to redemption. Associate "canvas" and "punch" with the art teaching scenes.

### 2. Emotional Connection
Connect words with feelings: "compassion," "appreciation," and "disappointment" all relate to Marcus's emotional transformation. Feeling the emotions helps remember the words.

### 3. Visual Imagery
Create mental pictures: Imagine a "blast" of wind, children "scratching" clay, Emma's "throne" of paintbrushes, and the "steep" courthouse steps.

### 4. Word Family Grouping
Learn related forms together:
- corrupt (adj./v.) → corruption (n.) → corruptly (adv.)
- appreciate (v.) → appreciation (n.) → appreciative (adj.)
- disappoint (v.) → disappointment (n.) → disappointed (adj.)

### 5. Context Clustering
Group words by scenes:
- Legal scene: courtroom, proceedings, offender, verify, public

- Emotional scene: compassion, loyal, desperately, appreciation, disappointment

### 6. Opposite Pairs
Learn through contrasts:
- corrupt ↔ honest
- brutal ↔ compassionate
- disappointment ↔ satisfaction
- fancy ↔ simple

### 7. Sound-Alike Memory
Use pronunciation to aid memory:
- "blast" - sounds explosive, like its meaning
- "punch" - the sound mimics the action
- "whip" - quick sound for quick action
- "scratch" - sounds scraping

### 8. Compound Word Breakdown
Understand word parts:
- down + town = downtown
- court + room = courtroom
- dis + appointed = disappointed
- short + term = short-term

### 9. Action-Based Memory
Physically act out words to remember them:
- Make a "punch" motion for punch
- "Scratch" something lightly
- "Stamp" your foot
- "Whip" your hand through the air

### 10. Sentence Pattern Templates
Remember useful patterns:
