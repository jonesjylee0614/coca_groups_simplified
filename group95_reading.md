## Reading Passage

### The Coastal Documentary

At seven **o'clock** in the morning, Emma sat in her small **booth** at the film festival, watching the **footage** of her latest documentary. Her **ambition** had always been to create films that would touch hearts **worldwide**, and today felt like the **spring** of her career was finally arriving. The **publishing** company that supported her work had **added** extra funding for this project about **coastal** wildlife, particularly focusing on the endangered sea **turtle**.

Emma opened her **diary** and began to write. The journey had been **challenging** from the start. She remembered the **bang** of the storm that nearly destroyed their cameras, the **shortage** of equipment when half their gear was lost at sea, and the moments when everything seemed **useless**. But her **curiosity** about nature and her deep **sympathy** for endangered species kept her going.

The film showed a **delicate** baby turtle making its way across the sand. The **comic** relief came from a crab that seemed to **instruct** the tiny creature on which direction to go. Emma had spent months learning to **sail** to reach remote beaches, navigating through **hostile** weather conditions. Her **rival** filmmakers thought she was crazy to take such risks, but their **denial** of climate change's impact only strengthened her resolve.

In one dramatic scene, lightning struck during a **flood** that threatened the turtle nests. The **grid** of protective barriers Emma's team had installed proved their worth. The **footage** captured the **tender** moment when baby turtles emerged after the storm, their **rolling** journey to the sea a symbol of resilience. Emma would often **gasp** at the beauty of these creatures, her **iPad** filled with notes and **speculation** about their survival patterns.

The **disclosure** of her findings challenged many **secular** scientific assumptions. The **divorce** between human activity and nature needed to end, she argued in her film. The **inappropriate** development along coastlines, the **soap** and **sodium** pollution in the waters, the **barn** turned into a resort destroying nesting grounds - all were documented with care.

Emma's team had faced **suspicious** locals during their **transit** through small fishing villages. Some thought they were government inspectors. In one memorable scene filmed in a narrow **alley**, a fisherman who initially seemed **cruel** in his **denial** of the problem later became their greatest ally. He helped them **carve** out safe zones for turtles and spoke about the **reliability** of traditional fishing methods that didn't harm marine life.

The documentary also explored the **hormone** disruptions in sea turtles caused by plastic pollution. Emma would **excite** her audiences during Q&A sessions, her passion contagious. She kept a **sack** of collected beach trash as a visual aid, showing everything from old **booth** signs to broken **comic** books that had washed ashore.

The festival director approached Emma's **booth**. "Your film shows remarkable **ease** in handling complex topics," she said. "The way you **bow** to the beauty of nature while maintaining scientific **reliability** is extraordinary. This isn't just **publishing** another nature documentary - you've created something that will inspire **worldwide** change."

Emma felt tears of joy. Her **ambition** was never about personal glory but about giving voice to the **useless**-feeling moments when individuals wonder if they can make a difference. The **challenging** path from her first **spring** of ideas to this moment had been worth every **hostile** wave and every **suspicious** glance.

The **disclosure** of the film's success came at three **o'clock** that afternoon when it won the festival's top prize. Standing on stage, Emma spoke about her **diary** entries from the darkest days. "When **lightning** destroyed our first **booth** setup on the beach, when the **shortage** of funds made me want to **gasp** and quit, when the **denial** of those in power seemed too strong to overcome - I remembered the **turtle**. Small, **delicate**, but with **ambition** coded into its very DNA to reach the sea."

She continued, "The **flood** of support from ordinary people, their **curiosity** about nature, their **sympathy** for these creatures, and their **tender** care for our planet gives me hope. The **grid** of connections between humans and nature is not **useless** - it's everything. We must **sail** forward together, leaving behind the **inappropriate** practices that harm our **coastal** ecosystems."

The audience erupted in applause. Emma's **rival** filmmakers stood to show respect. The **comic** irony wasn't lost on her - the same people who had shown **hostility** now wanted to collaborate. But she felt no **cruelty** in her heart, only a **secular** hope that transcended all differences.

As the evening arrived, Emma walked through the festival's **rolling** gardens. Her **iPad** buzzed with messages from **publishing** houses wanting to distribute the film **worldwide**. A **bang** of fireworks lit up the sky in celebration. She thought about the **barn** near her childhood home where she'd first felt the **spring** of **curiosity** about animals, where an old sailor had taught her to **sail**, where her grandmother's **diary** had planted seeds of **ambition**.

The **footage** would now travel across every **transit** point of the internet. The **disclosure** of environmental truths would no longer face **denial**. The **speculation** about whether one person could make a difference was answered. With **ease** and **reliability**, the message would spread: every **hostile** challenge could be met with **tender** determination, every **shortage** overcome with creativity, every **suspicious** doubt transformed into **excite**ment for change.

Emma sat down to **carve** out her plans for the next project. The **hormone** disruptions, the **sodium** levels, the **divorce** between development and conservation - all needed deeper exploration. She pulled out a fresh **sack** of memory cards, ready for new **footage**. The **alley**ways of small towns, the **coastal** regions untold, the stories waiting to **instruct** and inspire.

At seven **o'clock** that night, Emma wrote in her **diary**: "Today, the **lightning** of success struck. But tomorrow, like the **turtle**, I continue forward. The **worldwide** journey has just begun, and I **bow** in gratitude to every **delicate** creature that taught me that nothing is **useless** when done with love, that no **challenge** is too **cruel**, and that the **grid** of life connects us all in ways both **comic** and profound."

The **soap** opera of film festival drama faded into the background. What remained was **tender** and true - the **ambition** to **sail** forward, the **curiosity** to explore, and the **sympathy** to understand. The **rolling** waves would continue their ancient rhythm, the **coastal** turtles would persist in their **challenging** journey, and Emma would be there to document it all, one frame of **footage** at a time, with the **reliability** that comes from knowing that even in the face of **hostile** odds and **suspicious** critics, the truth of nature's beauty would always **excite** the human heart.

## Chinese Translation

### 海岸纪录片

早上七点钟,艾玛坐在电影节的小展位里,观看她最新纪录片的影像素材。她的抱负一直是创作能触动全球人心的电影,而今天感觉就像她事业的春天终于到来了。支持她工作的出版公司为这个关于海岸野生动物的项目增加了额外资金,特别聚焦于濒危海龟。

艾玛打开日记开始写作。这段旅程从一开始就充满挑战。她记得那场几乎摧毁摄像机的暴风雨的巨响,当一半设备丢失时的设备短缺,以及一切似乎都变得毫无用处的时刻。但她对自然的好奇心和对濒危物种的深切同情让她坚持了下来。

这部电影展示了一只娇嫩的小海龟穿过沙滩的过程。喜剧性的缓解来自一只螃蟹,它似乎在指导这个小生物该往哪个方向走。艾玛花了几个月学习航海以到达偏远的海滩,在恶劣的天气条件下航行。她的竞争对手电影制作人认为她冒这样的风险很疯狂,但他们对气候变化影响的否认只是加强了她的决心。

在一个戏剧性的场景中,闪电在威胁海龟巢穴的洪水期间击落。艾玛团队安装的保护栅栏网证明了它们的价值。影像捕捉到了暴风雨后小海龟出现的温柔时刻,它们向海洋滚动的旅程象征着坚韧。艾玛常常会对这些生物的美丽发出惊叹,她的iPad上满是关于它们生存模式的笔记和推测。

她的发现披露挑战了许多世俗的科学假设。她在电影中论证,人类活动与自然之间的分离需要结束。海岸线上不当的开发,水域中的肥皂和钠污染,被改造成度假村而破坏筑巢地的谷仓——所有这些都被仔细记录下来。

在经过小渔村的过境期间,艾玛的团队面临着可疑的当地人。有些人以为他们是政府检查员。在一个难忘的场景中,在一条狭窄的小巷里拍摄,一位渔民最初似乎对问题的否认很残酷,后来却成为了他们最大的盟友。他帮助他们为海龟开辟出安全区域,并谈论了不伤害海洋生物的传统捕鱼方法的可靠性。

这部纪录片还探讨了塑料污染对海龟造成的激素紊乱。艾玛在问答环节中会让观众兴奋,她的热情具有传染性。她保留了一袋收集的海滩垃圾作为视觉辅助,展示从旧展位标志到冲上岸的破损漫画书的各种东西。

电影节主任走近艾玛的展位。"你的电影在处理复杂话题时表现出非凡的从容,"她说。"你在保持科学可靠性的同时向自然之美致敬的方式非同寻常。这不仅仅是出版另一部自然纪录片——你创造了能够激发全球变革的作品。"

艾玛感到喜悦的泪水。她的抱负从来不是为了个人荣耀,而是为了给那些感觉无用的时刻发声,当个人怀疑自己是否能有所作为时。从她最初的想法春天到此刻的充满挑战的道路,每一个敌对的浪潮和每一个怀疑的眼神都是值得的。

那天下午三点钟,电影的成功披露到来,它赢得了电影节的最高奖项。站在舞台上,艾玛谈到了她在最黑暗日子里的日记条目。"当闪电摧毁了我们在海滩上的第一个展位设置,当资金短缺让我想要惊呼并放弃,当权力者的否认似乎太强大而无法克服时——我记得了海龟。它们小小的,娇嫩的,但抱负已编码在它们的DNA中,要到达大海。"

她继续说:"普通人的支持洪流,他们对自然的好奇心,他们对这些生物的同情,以及他们对我们星球的温柔关怀给了我希望。人类与自然之间的联系网格不是无用的——它就是一切。我们必须一起航行前进,抛弃伤害我们海岸生态系统的不当做法。"

观众爆发出掌声。艾玛的竞争对手电影制作人站起来表示尊重。她并没有错过这个喜剧性的讽刺——那些曾表现出敌意的人现在想要合作。但她心中没有残酷,只有一种超越所有差异的世俗希望。

当晚上到来时,艾玛走过电影节起伏的花园。她的iPad上充满了来自想要在全球发行这部电影的出版社的消息。烟花的巨响照亮了庆祝的天空。她想起了童年家附近的谷仓,在那里她第一次感受到对动物好奇心的萌芽,一位老水手在那里教她航海,她祖母的日记在那里种下了抱负的种子。

这些影像现在将通过互联网的每一个中转点传播。环境真相的披露将不再面临否认。关于一个人是否能有所作为的推测得到了答案。凭借从容和可靠性,信息将会传播:每一个敌对的挑战都可以用温柔的决心来应对,每一次短缺都可以用创造力克服,每一个可疑的怀疑都可以转化为对变革的兴奋。

艾玛坐下来规划她的下一个项目。激素紊乱、钠含量、开发与保护之间的分离——所有这些都需要更深入的探索。她拿出一袋新的存储卡,准备拍摄新的影像。小镇的小巷、未被讲述的海岸地区、等待指导和激励的故事。

那天晚上七点钟,艾玛在日记中写道:"今天,成功的闪电击中了我。但明天,像海龟一样,我继续前进。全球之旅才刚刚开始,我向每一个娇嫩的生物致敬,它们教会我,只要用爱去做,没有什么是无用的,没有挑战太残酷,生命的网格以既喜剧又深刻的方式将我们所有人联系在一起。"

电影节戏剧的肥皂剧消退到背景中。留下的是温柔而真实的东西——向前航行的抱负、探索的好奇心和理解的同情心。起伏的波浪将继续它们古老的节奏,海岸海龟将在它们充满挑战的旅程中坚持下去,艾玛将在那里记录这一切,一次一帧影像,带着来自知道即使面对敌对的困难和可疑的批评者,自然之美的真理也总会激发人类内心的可靠性。
