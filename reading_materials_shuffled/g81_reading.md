**#MoralReflection** – A story of choices and principles

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Elena walked through the **wet** /wet/ (adj. 潮湿的) streets, her mind heavy with thought. She had to **match** /mætʃ/ (v. 匹配; n. 比赛) her actions with her values, but the **proposal** /prəˈpoʊzl/ (n. 提案;求婚) her boss made was anything but **ethical** /ˈeθɪkl/ (adj. 道德的). The company wanted to **rent** /rent/ (v. 租用; n. 租金) land that belonged to **poor** /pʊr/ (adj. 贫穷的) families, offering them far less than the property was worth.

As a **contributor** /kənˈtrɪbjətər/ (n. 贡献者) to the project, Elena couldn't **distract** /dɪˈstrækt/ (v. 分散注意力) herself from the truth. The development would span several **acres** /ˈeɪkərz/ (n. 英亩) and **release** /rɪˈliːs/ (v. 释放;发布) pollution into the nearby lake. The **chart** /tʃɑːrt/ (n. 图表) showing profit margins was impressive, but at what cost?

"**May** /meɪ/ (modal v. 可能;可以) I speak with you?" Elena asked her colleague, David. They met in a quiet corner of the office. "I know this is a **rush** /rʌʃ/ (n. 匆忙; v. 冲) job, but we need to **regard** /rɪˈɡɑːrd/ (v. 认为;注意) the consequences. **And/or** /ænd/ ɔːr/ (conj. 和/或) we continue, this will affect people's lives."

David nodded. "You're right. But they won't **dare** /der/ (v. 敢于) listen to us. The board sees us as just another **level** /ˈlevl/ (n. 水平;级别) of bureaucracy." He paused, then added, "There's even talk of a local **gang** /ɡæŋ/ (n. 团伙) **driving** /ˈdraɪvɪŋ/ (v. 驾驶;驱使) people off their land."

Elena felt her heart **stretch** /stretʃ/ (v. 延伸;拉伸) with anxiety. She couldn't let this happen. That evening, she stood by the **toilet** /ˈtɔɪlət/ (n. 厕所) mirror in her apartment, looking at her reflection. This wasn't just about business—it was about who she wanted to be.

The next morning, Elena requested a meeting with the board. She presented an alternative plan, showing how they could **touch** /tʌtʃ/ (v. 触摸;影响) people's lives positively. The **fascinating** /ˈfæsɪneɪtɪŋ/ (adj. 迷人的) part was that her proposal would cost less **and/or** take less time.

"We should **kiss** /kɪs/ (v. 亲吻) goodbye to the old way of doing things," she concluded. The board members exchanged glances. One leaned forward: "Your **match** with our company values is clear. Let's move forward with your plan."

Elena walked out feeling lighter. She had taken a risk, but her conscience was clear. Sometimes the right choice requires courage, not just calculation.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

埃琳娜走在潮湿的街道上,思绪沉重。她必须让自己的行为与价值观相匹配,但老板提出的提案一点也不道德。公司想要租用属于贫穷家庭的土地,给他们的报价远低于房产的实际价值。

作为项目的贡献者,埃琳娜无法让自己不去关注真相。这个开发项目将横跨几英亩土地,并向附近的湖泊释放污染物。显示利润率的图表令人印象深刻,但代价是什么呢?

"我可以和你谈谈吗?"埃琳娜问她的同事大卫。他们在办公室的一个安静角落见面。"我知道这是个紧急的工作,但我们需要注意后果。如果我们继续下去,这将影响人们的生活。"

大卫点点头。"你说得对。但他们不敢听我们的。董事会只把我们看作官僚体系中的又一个级别。"他停顿了一下,然后补充道:"甚至有传言说当地的团伙正在驱赶人们离开他们的土地。"

埃琳娜感到心中的焦虑在延伸。她不能让这种事发生。那天晚上,她站在公寓的厕所镜子前,看着自己的倒影。这不仅仅是关于生意——而是关于她想成为什么样的人。

第二天早上,埃琳娜要求与董事会开会。她提出了一个替代方案,展示了他们如何能够积极地影响人们的生活。迷人的是,她的提案成本更低,或者说耗时更少。

"我们应该与老的做事方式吻别了,"她总结道。董事会成员交换了眼神。一个人向前倾身说:"你与我们公司价值观的匹配是清晰的。让我们按照你的计划前进。"

埃琳娜走出来时感觉轻松多了。她冒了险,但她的良心是清白的。有时候正确的选择需要勇气,而不仅仅是计算。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "She had to match her actions with her values, but the proposal her boss made was anything but ethical."

**分析:** "match...with..." 表示"使...与...相配"。"anything but" 是一个固定搭配,意为"决不;根本不",用于强烈的否定。这句话通过对比强调了道德困境。

**亮点:** "anything but" 的使用比简单的 "not ethical" 更有力度,更能体现说话者的情感态度。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "As a contributor to the project, Elena couldn't distract herself from the truth."

**分析:** "as a..." 引导方式状语,说明身份。"distract oneself from" 表示"使自己不去注意某事",这里用否定形式强调她无法逃避真相。

**亮点:** 通过"无法分散注意力"来表达"无法忽视",是一种更细腻的表达方式。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Elena felt her heart stretch with anxiety."

**分析:** "stretch with" 将心理感受具象化,用"延伸"这个物理动作来形容焦虑的感觉在扩大。这是一种有效的感官描写。

**亮点:** 使用具体的动词来描述抽象情感,让读者能够感同身受。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Sometimes the right choice requires courage, not just calculation."

**分析:** 这是一个总结性的哲理句。"not just...but..." 的变体结构,通过对比 "courage" 和 "calculation" 来强调道德决策的核心。

**亮点:** 简洁有力的对比句,适合作为故事的收尾,给读者留下思考空间。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "anything but" 的用法

**原句:** "The proposal her boss made was anything but ethical."

**聚焦:** "anything but" 的强烈否定意义

**用法说明:** 
"anything but" 表示"决不;根本不",语气比简单的否定更强烈。它强调事物与描述词完全相反。

**类似表达对比:**
- "not ethical" (不道德的) - 简单否定
- "anything but ethical" (根本不道德) - 强烈否定
- "far from ethical" (远非道德的) - 强调差距

**可替换句:** "The proposal her boss made was completely unethical." (但原句更有力度)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 情态动词 "may" 的用法

**原句:** "May I speak with you?"

**聚焦:** 情态动词 "may" 表示请求许可

**用法说明:**
"May I..." 是一种礼貌的请求方式,比 "Can I..." 更正式。在商务或正式场合经常使用。

**语气对比:**
- "Can I speak with you?" (比较随意)
- "May I speak with you?" (比较正式、礼貌)
- "Could I speak with you?" (委婉、更客气)

**可替换句:** "Would it be possible for me to speak with you?" (更加正式和委婉)
