**#Adventure** – A story of dreams and determination

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **world** /wɜːrld/ (n. 世界) seemed small from the mountain **top** /tɑːp/ (n. 顶部). Maya adjusted her **uniform** /ˈjuːnɪfɔːrm/ (n./adj. 制服;一致的), the blue fabric marking her as part of the rescue team. She had worked hard to **employ** /ɪmˈplɔɪ/ (v. 雇用;使用) her skills here. **Okay** /ˌoʊˈkeɪ/ (adj./interj. 好的;可以), she thought. **Okay**, I can do this.

Below, a **coalition** /ˌkoʊəˈlɪʃn/ (n. 联盟;联合) of volunteers had gathered. They came to search for a lost hiker. The man had a **tattoo** /tæˈtuː/ (n./v. 纹身) of a bird on his arm—that was the only clear detail. Someone would **suspect** /səˈspekt/ (v./n. 怀疑;嫌疑犯) he had wandered off the path on purpose, but Maya didn't judge. Her job was to find him, not to question his choices.

"**Stay** /steɪ/ (v. 停留;保持) focused," said Captain Torres. "The **capacity** /kəˈpæsɪti/ (n. 能力;容量) of this team depends on clear communication. Don't **forget** /fərˈɡet/ (v. 忘记) your training."

Maya nodded. She wouldn't **forget**. Years ago, she had been a **gifted** /ˈɡɪftɪd/ (adj. 有天赋的) student in biology. Everyone expected her to **become** /bɪˈkʌm/ (v. 成为;变得) a scientist. But after volunteering during a wildfire, she realized her calling was different. She wanted to **pursue** /pərˈsuː/ (v. 追求;从事) rescue work, to be where **activity** /ækˈtɪvəti/ (n. 活动;行动) saved lives directly.

The search began. The team spread out across the rocky terrain. Maya carried a **gun** /ɡʌn/ (n. 枪;炮)—not a weapon, but a flare **gun** for signaling. She moved carefully, checking behind every **rock** /rɑːk/ (n. 岩石;摇动) and fallen tree. The afternoon sun was hot, and she could feel it in her **bone** /boʊn/ (n. 骨头;骨骼) s—that deep, tired heat.

"Over here!" A voice called. Maya ran to the spot. It was Jake, another volunteer. He had found footprints leading toward a cliff. "**Okay**," Maya said, "we need to **stay** together. This area is dangerous."

They followed the trail. Soon, they heard a weak voice. "Help... please..."

The man was trapped in a small cave, his leg caught between rocks. He looked pale and exhausted. Maya **employ** ed her medical training immediately. "We've got you," she said. "What's your name?"

"David."

"**Okay**, David. You're going to be fine. We just need to **stay** calm and work together."

While Jake called for backup, Maya examined David's injury. She noticed his **tattoo**—the bird he'd gotten after his son was born. He told her the story while she worked, his voice shaking. "I came up here to think. My life felt like a **controversy** /ˈkɑːntrəversi/ (n. 争议;争论). Work pressure, family stress. I just needed space."

"I understand," Maya said **gently**. "But running away isn't the answer. Sometimes we need to **pursue** help, not solitude."

David's eyes filled with tears. "You sound like my wife. She's been trying to tell me that for months."

"She sounds **influential** /ˌɪnfluˈenʃl/ (adj. 有影响力的)," Maya replied. "You should listen to her."

The rescue team arrived with equipment. They carefully freed David's leg. It wasn't broken, just badly bruised. As they carried him down on a stretcher, Maya walked beside him. "Will I be **okay**?" he asked.

"You'll be fine. But you need to talk to someone about what you're feeling. Life is **terrific** /təˈrɪfɪk/ (adj. 极好的;可怕的) and terrible at the same time. That's normal. What's not **okay** is facing it alone."

At the base camp, David's wife rushed forward. They embraced, and Maya stepped back to give them privacy. Captain Torres approached her. "Good work today. You **employ** ed both your skills and your heart."

Maya smiled, tired but satisfied. She thought about her journey—how she had **become** who she was meant to be. Not through a straight path, but through choosing what mattered most. The **world** needed people who could **pursue** both dreams and duty.

That evening, back in town, Maya stopped at a small restaurant. The walls were decorated with photos of the mountain, the **rock** faces she knew so well. A news **article** on the counter mentioned the rescue. "Local Team Shows **Capacity** for Compassion," the headline read.

Her phone buzzed. A text from David: "Thank you. You gave me a **hint** /hɪnt/ (n./v. 暗示;提示) about living differently. I won't **forget** it."

Maya replied: "**Stay** strong. Follow the **guideline** /ˈɡaɪdlaɪn/ (n. 指导方针;准则) s your doctor gives you, and talk to your family. That's the real rescue."

She thought about the **coalition** of helpers who made the day work—each person using their **capacity** in service of another. No one was a **Hispanic** /hɪˈspænɪk/ (adj./n. 西班牙裔的;西班牙裔人) or white or anything else first. They were just humans helping humans.

The **world** was a **billion** /ˈbɪljən/ (num./n. 十亿) small acts of kindness. Maybe that's all it needed to be. Maya finished her meal and walked home under the stars. She felt **okay**—no, better than **okay**. She felt alive, purposeful, complete.

The next day would bring new challenges. But she wouldn't **forget** why she did this work. She wouldn't **forget** that being **gifted** didn't mean following others' expectations. It meant finding what made you **become** fully yourself. And in that becoming, you could help others do the same.

As she drifted to sleep, Maya thought about David's **tattoo**—the bird. She hoped he would learn to fly again, not away from his problems, but toward solutions. That's what real courage looked like. Not the absence of fear, but the **capacity** to move forward despite it.

And that, she thought as dreams took her, was a **terrific** way to live.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

从山顶看,世界似乎很小。玛雅调整了她的制服,蓝色的布料标志着她是救援队的一员。她努力工作来在这里运用她的技能。好的,她想。好的,我能做到。

下面,一个志愿者联盟已经集合。他们来寻找一名失踪的徒步旅行者。那个男人手臂上有一只鸟的纹身——这是唯一清晰的细节。有人可能会怀疑他是故意偏离道路的,但玛雅不评判。她的工作是找到他,而不是质疑他的选择。

"保持专注,"托雷斯队长说。"这个团队的能力取决于清晰的沟通。不要忘记你的训练。"

玛雅点点头。她不会忘记。多年前,她曾是一名有天赋的生物学学生。每个人都期望她成为一名科学家。但在野火期间做志愿者后,她意识到她的使命不同。她想追求救援工作,在活动直接拯救生命的地方。

搜索开始了。团队分散在岩石地形上。玛雅携带着一把枪——不是武器,而是用于信号的信号枪。她小心移动,检查每块岩石和倒下的树木后面。下午的阳光很热,她能在骨头里感受到它——那种深沉、疲倦的热。

"在这里!"一个声音喊道。玛雅跑到那个地方。是杰克,另一位志愿者。他发现了通向悬崖的脚印。"好的,"玛雅说,"我们需要待在一起。这个区域很危险。"

他们跟着踪迹。很快,他们听到一个微弱的声音。"救命...请..."

那个男人被困在一个小洞穴里,他的腿被卡在岩石之间。他看起来苍白而疲惫。玛雅立即运用了她的医疗训练。"我们找到你了,"她说。"你叫什么名字?"

"大卫。"

"好的,大卫。你会没事的。我们只需要保持冷静,共同努力。"

当杰克呼叫支援时,玛雅检查了大卫的伤势。她注意到他的纹身——那只他儿子出生后纹的鸟。他一边工作一边给她讲这个故事,声音颤抖。"我来这里思考。我的生活感觉像一场争议。工作压力,家庭压力。我只是需要空间。"

"我理解,"玛雅温柔地说。"但逃跑不是答案。有时我们需要追求帮助,而不是孤独。"

大卫的眼睛充满泪水。"你听起来像我妻子。她几个月来一直试图告诉我这个。"

"她听起来很有影响力,"玛雅回答。"你应该听她的。"

救援队带着设备到达了。他们小心地释放了大卫的腿。它没有骨折,只是严重擦伤。当他们用担架把他抬下来时,玛雅走在他旁边。"我会没事吗?"他问。

"你会没事的。但你需要和某人谈谈你的感受。生活同时是极好的和可怕的。这是正常的。不正常的是独自面对它。"

在大本营,大卫的妻子冲了上来。他们拥抱,玛雅退后给他们隐私。托雷斯队长走近她。"今天工作得很好。你既运用了你的技能,也运用了你的心。"

玛雅微笑着,疲倦但满足。她想到了她的旅程——她如何成为她注定要成为的人。不是通过一条笔直的道路,而是通过选择最重要的东西。世界需要能够追求梦想和责任的人。

那天晚上,回到镇上,玛雅在一家小餐馆停了下来。墙上装饰着她非常熟悉的山和岩石面的照片。柜台上的一篇新闻文章提到了救援。"当地团队展现同情心的能力,"标题写道。

她的手机嗡嗡作响。大卫发来短信:"谢谢你。你给了我关于不同生活的暗示。我不会忘记它。"

玛雅回复:"保持坚强。遵循医生给你的指导方针,和你的家人交谈。这才是真正的救援。"

她想到了使这一天工作的帮助者联盟——每个人都用他们的能力为他人服务。没有人首先是西班牙裔或白人或其他任何东西。他们只是人类帮助人类。

世界是十亿个小小的善举。也许这就是它需要的全部。玛雅吃完饭,在星空下走回家。她感觉还好——不,比还好更好。她感到活着、有目标、完整。

第二天会带来新的挑战。但她不会忘记为什么做这项工作。她不会忘记,有天赋并不意味着遵循他人的期望。它意味着找到让你完全成为自己的东西。在那个成为过程中,你可以帮助别人做同样的事。

当她进入梦乡时,玛雅想到了大卫的纹身——那只鸟。她希望他会再次学会飞翔,不是逃离他的问题,而是朝着解决方案。这就是真正的勇气看起来的样子。不是没有恐惧,而是尽管恐惧仍有前进的能力。

而这,她想着梦境带她走时,是一种极好的生活方式。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子1
**原句:** "The capacity of this team depends on clear communication."

**分析:** "depend on"是固定搭配,表示"依赖于"。将抽象的"capacity"(能力)与具体的"communication"联系起来,说明团队合作的关键。

**要点:** 使用"depend on"结构可以清晰地表达因果关系或依赖关系。

---

### 句子2
**原句:** "Sometimes we need to pursue help, not solitude."

**分析:** "pursue"原意是"追求",这里将"help"(帮助)作为追求的对象,形成新颖的搭配。"not...but..."的省略形式,用逗号连接对比项。

**要点:** 将常见动词与非常规宾语搭配,可以创造新鲜的表达效果。

---

### 句子3
**原句:** "Life is terrific and terrible at the same time."

**分析:** 使用"and"连接两个形容词相近(都以terr-开头)但意义相反的词,创造修辞效果。"at the same time"强调这种矛盾的共存。

**要点:** 利用词形相似但意义相反的词可以增强表达的张力和记忆点。

---

### 句子4
**原句:** "Not the absence of fear, but the capacity to move forward despite it."

**分析:** 省略了主语和be动词,直接用"Not...but..."对比两个名词短语。"despite it"简洁地表达"尽管有恐惧"。

**要点:** 省略式的对比结构简洁有力,适合表达核心观点或定义概念。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 焦点1: 不定式表示目的

**原句:** "She wanted to pursue rescue work, to be where activity saved lives directly."

**聚焦:** 两个不定式短语表示目的

**用法:** 第一个不定式"to pursue"作"wanted"的宾语,第二个"to be"与第一个并列,进一步说明目的。"where"引导地点状语从句。

**可替换句:** "She wanted to pursue rescue work so that she could be in places where activity saved lives." (用目的状语从句,更详细但不够简洁)

---

### 焦点2: 动名词作主语表达概念

**原句:** "Being gifted didn't mean following others' expectations."

**聚焦:** 动名词短语作主语和宾语

**用法:** "Being gifted"作主语,"following"作mean的宾语。两个动名词都表示一般性概念,不指具体的一次行为。

**可替换句:** "If you are gifted, it doesn't mean you should follow others' expectations." (用条件句,更明确但失去了格言式的简洁)

---

- The controversy between following expectations and following your heart
- Whether influential people are those who employ their gifts for others

---

3. forget后可跟不定式或动名词,意思不同:forget to do(忘记要做)/forget doing(忘记做过)
4. okay可以作形容词"好的"、感叹词"行"、名词"同意",用法灵活
