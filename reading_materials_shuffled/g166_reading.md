## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The old **steel** /stiːl/ (n. 钢铁) door of the community center opened with a creak. Sarah, a **nurse** /nɜːrs/ (n. 护士) who had just finished her shift, stepped into the **interior** /ɪnˈtɪriər/ (n./adj. 内部;内部的). The walls needed **fresh** /freʃ/ (adj. 新鲜的;新的) paint, but she loved this place. Here, her **training** /ˈtreɪnɪŋ/ (n. 训练;培训) as a medical professional served a purpose beyond the hospital—helping people who had nowhere else to turn.

"We **include** /ɪnˈkluːd/ (v. 包括) everyone," she told the new volunteers. "**Any** /ˈeni/ (adj. 任何的) person who needs help can come here." The center provided basic health checks, **govern** /ˈɡʌvərn/ (v. 管理;统治) themselves by simple rules of respect and dignity. The **staff** /stæf/ (n. 员工;全体职员) was small—just three people—but they worked with **independent** /ˌɪndɪˈpendənt/ (adj. 独立的) spirit.

Sarah had been a **Canadian** /kəˈneɪdiən/ (adj./n. 加拿大的;加拿大人) originally, moving south for work. She understood what it meant to **fight** /faɪt/ (v./n. 战斗;斗争) for a place in a new country. Now she fought **on behalf of** /ɪn bɪˈhæf əv/ (prep. 代表) those who couldn't fight for themselves.

The center's main work was **consumption** /kənˈsʌmpʃn/ (n. 消费;消耗) of resources—medicine, food, time—but it was worth it. Every week, they helped dozens of people. A **collector** /kəˈlektər/ (n. 收藏家;收集者) of medical supplies had donated boxes of bandages. A local shop sent **fresh** /freʃ/ (adj. 新鲜的) food daily. The community's **sympathy** /ˈsɪmpəθi/ (n. 同情;同情心) kept the center alive.

One evening, as **rain** /reɪn/ (n./v. 雨;下雨) began to fall, a man rushed through the door. "Please, I need help," he said. His arm was bleeding from an **attack** /əˈtæk/ (n./v. 攻击;袭击) by street dogs. Sarah immediately guided him to the treatment room. The **interior** /ɪnˈtɪriər/ (n. 内部) was simple but clean.

"Don't worry," Sarah said, cleaning the wound. "We won't **cancel** /ˈkænsəl/ (v. 取消) our care for **any** /ˈeni/ (adj. 任何的) reason. **Practically** /ˈpræktɪkli/ (adv. 几乎;实际上), you're **independent** /ˌɪndɪˈpendənt/ (adj. 独立的) now, but everyone needs help sometimes."

The man's name was Robert. As Sarah bandaged his arm, he told her about his life. He had once played **golf** /ɡɑːlf/ (n. 高尔夫球) at expensive clubs, lived for the **glory** /ˈɡlɔːri/ (n. 荣耀;光荣) of success. But a **destiny** /ˈdestəni/ (n. 命运) he never expected had led him to the streets. He wasn't asking for **sympathy** /ˈsɪmpəθi/ (n. 同情), just a chance to heal.

"The **corps** /kɔːr/ (n. 军团;团队) of volunteers here are amazing," Robert said. "They **throw** /θroʊ/ (v. 扔;投掷) themselves into helping others **without** /wɪˈðaʊt/ (prep. 没有) asking for **any** /ˈeni/ (adj. 任何的) reward."

Sarah smiled. "We do it **on behalf of** /ɪn bɪˈhæf əv/ (代表) humanity. The **staff** /stæf/ (n. 员工) here believe everyone deserves **fresh** /freʃ/ (adj. 新的) starts."

A week later, Robert returned—not as a patient, but as a volunteer. He wanted to join the **fight** /faɪt/ (n. 战斗) to help others. Sarah showed him the **training** /ˈtreɪnɪŋ/ (n. 训练) schedule, explained how they **govern** /ˈɡʌvərn/ (v. 管理) the center's operations. The **steel** /stiːl/ (n. 钢铁) door that had once seemed like a barrier now felt like a gateway to purpose.

"**Include** /ɪnˈkluːd/ (v. 包括) me in **any** /ˈeni/ (adj. 任何的) way you can," Robert said. "I don't have medical **training** /ˈtreɪnɪŋ/ (n. 训练), but I can organize supplies. I used to be a **collector** /kəˈlektər/ (n. 收集者) of art—now I'll collect hope."

Sarah felt moved. The center's **consumption** /kənˈsʌmpʃn/ (n. 消耗) of resources was high, but what it produced was higher: transformation. People who came broken left with **independent** /ˌɪndɪˈpendənt/ (adj. 独立的) spirits renewed. The **rain** /reɪn/ (n. 雨) outside continued to fall, but inside the **interior** /ɪnˈtɪriər/ (n. 内部) of the center, there was warmth.

That night, as Sarah locked the **steel** /stiːl/ (adj. 钢铁般的) door, she thought about **destiny** /ˈdestəni/ (n. 命运). Perhaps it wasn't something that happened to you, but something you created **on behalf of** /ɪn bɪˈhæf əv/ (代表) others. The **corps** /kɔːr/ (n. 团队) of helpers would **include** /ɪnˈkluːd/ (v. 包括) one more person tomorrow. And that was its own kind of **glory** /ˈɡlɔːri/ (n. 荣耀)—not the **golf** /ɡɑːlf/ (n. 高尔夫球) club kind, but something **practically** /ˈpræktɪkli/ (adv. 实际上) more valuable. The **nurse** /nɜːrs/ (n. 护士) had healed more than wounds; she had helped **throw** /θroʊ/ (v. 抛弃) away despair and **fight** /faɪt/ (v. 战斗) for a **fresh** /freʃ/ (adj. 新的) future.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

社区中心的旧钢门吱呀一声打开了。莎拉,一位刚结束轮班的护士,走进内部。墙壁需要刷新漆,但她热爱这个地方。在这里,她作为医疗专业人员的训练服务于医院之外的目的——帮助那些无处可去的人。

"我们包括每个人,"她告诉新志愿者。"任何需要帮助的人都可以来这里。"中心提供基本的健康检查,通过尊重和尊严的简单规则来管理自己。员工很少——只有三个人——但他们以独立的精神工作。

莎拉最初是加拿大人,为了工作南下。她理解在一个新国家为一席之地而战斗意味着什么。现在她代表那些无法为自己战斗的人而战斗。

中心的主要工作是资源的消耗——药品、食物、时间——但这是值得的。每周,他们帮助数十人。一位医疗用品收集者捐赠了几箱绷带。当地一家商店每天送来新鲜食物。社区的同情心让中心保持活力。

一天傍晚,当雨开始下落时,一个男人冲进门来。"请帮帮我,"他说。他的手臂因为被街狗攻击而流血。莎拉立即引导他到治疗室。内部简单但干净。

"别担心,"莎拉边清洗伤口边说。"我们不会因为任何原因取消我们的照顾。实际上,你现在是独立的,但每个人有时都需要帮助。"

这个男人名叫罗伯特。当莎拉给他的手臂包扎时,他讲述了自己的生活。他曾在昂贵的俱乐部打高尔夫球,为成功的荣耀而活。但一个他从未预料到的命运把他带到了街头。他不是在寻求同情,只是一个治愈的机会。

"这里的志愿者团队很棒,"罗伯特说。"他们无私地投入帮助他人,不要求任何回报。"

莎拉微笑了。"我们代表人性而做。这里的员工相信每个人都值得拥有新的开始。"

一周后,罗伯特回来了——不是作为病人,而是作为志愿者。他想加入帮助他人的战斗。莎拉向他展示了训练时间表,解释了他们如何管理中心的运作。那扇曾经看起来像屏障的钢门现在感觉像是通往目标的门户。

"以任何方式包括我,"罗伯特说。"我没有医疗训练,但我可以组织物资。我曾经是艺术收藏家——现在我要收集希望。"

莎拉很感动。中心对资源的消耗很高,但它产生的东西更高:转变。破碎而来的人带着更新的独立精神离开。外面的雨继续下着,但在中心的内部,有温暖。

那天晚上,当莎拉锁上钢门时,她想到了命运。也许它不是发生在你身上的事情,而是你代表他人创造的东西。明天,帮助者团队将包括多一个人。那是它自己的一种荣耀——不是高尔夫俱乐部的那种,而是实际上更有价值的东西。护士治愈的不仅仅是伤口;她帮助抛弃了绝望,为新的未来而战斗。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Here, her training as a medical professional served a purpose beyond the hospital—helping people who had nowhere else to turn."

**分析:** "served a purpose" 是固定搭配,意为"服务于某个目的"。"beyond the hospital" 作后置定语修饰 "purpose"。破折号后的动名词短语 "helping people..." 是同位语,解释 "purpose" 的具体内容。"who had nowhere else to turn" 是定语从句修饰 "people"。

**亮点:** 通过破折号和同位语的使用,将抽象的"目的"具体化,让读者清楚理解主人公的动机。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "She understood what it meant to fight for a place in a new country."

**分析:** "what it meant to..." 是宾语从句,作 "understood" 的宾语。其中 "it" 是形式主语,真正的主语是不定式短语 "to fight for a place in a new country"。这种 "what it means to do sth" 结构在英语中很常用,表示"做某事意味着什么"。

**亮点:** 通过自己的经历来理解他人的处境,展现了同理心,是人物性格塑造的重要细节。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "People who came broken left with independent spirits renewed."

**分析:** 这是一个简洁有力的对比句。"who came broken" 是定语从句修饰 "people","broken" 作主语补足语,说明来时的状态。"left with..." 说明离开时的状态,"renewed" 是过去分词作后置定语修饰 "spirits"。

**亮点:** 用 "came broken" 和 "left...renewed" 的对比,生动展现了中心对人们的积极影响,是典型的"对比式"写作技巧。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Perhaps it wasn't something that happened to you, but something you created on behalf of others."

**分析:** 这是一个 "not...but..." 对比结构。两个 "something" 后分别跟着定语从句。第一个从句 "that happened to you" 表示被动接受,第二个从句 "you created on behalf of others" 表示主动创造。

**亮点:** 通过这个哲理性的句子,升华了故事主题,让读者思考命运的本质。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "on behalf of" 的用法

**原句:** "Now she fought on behalf of those who couldn't fight for themselves."

**聚焦:** 介词短语 "on behalf of" (代表)

**用法说明:** 
"on behalf of" 是固定搭配,意为"代表、为了...的利益"。它后面通常接名词或代词,表示替某人做某事。这个短语在正式英语中很常见,特别是在演讲、法律文件等场合。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: she
- 谓语: fought
- 状语: on behalf of those who couldn't fight for themselves
  - "those" 后接定语从句 "who couldn't fight for themselves"

**可替换句:** "Now she fought for those who couldn't fight for themselves." (用 "for" 替换,意思相近但不如 "on behalf of" 正式)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 形容词作主语补足语

**原句:** "People who came broken left with independent spirits renewed."

**聚焦:** "broken" 作主语补足语

**用法说明:**
在某些动词(如 come, go, leave, arrive 等表示移动或状态变化的动词)后,可以直接使用形容词作主语补足语,说明主语的状态。"came broken" 完整形式是 "came (in a state of being) broken",省略了中间的介词短语。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: People (who came broken)
- 谓语: left
- 状语: with independent spirits renewed

**可替换句:** "People who came in a broken state left with their independent spirits renewed." (添加介词短语,更明确但不如原句简洁有力)
