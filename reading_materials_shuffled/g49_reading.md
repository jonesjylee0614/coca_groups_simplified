**#TechAndFuture** – A story of innovation and values

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

At exactly 7 **o'clock** /əˈklɑːk/ (n. 点钟), Maya walked into the state capitol building, wearing a simple **t-shirt** /ˈtiːʃɜːrt/ (n. T恤) and jeans—**like** /laɪk/ (prep. 像) any other young **technical** /ˈteknɪkl/ (adj. 技术的) consultant, **except** she wasn't here to sell software. She was here to testify about the **ecosystem** /ˈiːkoʊsɪstəm/ (n. 生态系统) crisis threatening her **hometown**.

The **governor** /ˈɡʌvərnər/ (n. 州长) sat at the front, flanked by advisors who seemed more interested **in** **insurance** /ɪnˈʃʊrəns/ (n. 保险) documents than environmental reports. Maya felt a wave of **shame** /ʃeɪm/ (n. 羞愧) —not for herself, but for a system that could **exclude** /ɪkˈskluːd/ (v. 排除) urgent voices.

"What's your **intent** /ɪnˈtent/ (n. 意图)?" the **governor** asked, his tone suggesting she should **deal** /diːl/ (v. 处理) quickly with her remarks. Maya took a breath and began. "My **intent** is to **refer** /rɪˈfɜːr/ (v. 提及) to data you may have seen **under** /ˈʌndər/ (prep. 在...下面) different circumstances. This isn't just an **issue** /ˈɪʃuː/ (n. 问题) of pollution—it's about our **democratic** /ˌdeməˈkrætɪk/ (adj. 民主的) responsibility."

She pulled out her laptop. "Let me show you the **headline** /ˈhedlaɪn/ (n. 头条) from last week: '**Ecosystem** Collapse Threatens **Average** /ˈævərɪdʒ/ (adj. 平均的) Family's **Retirement** /rɪˈtaɪərmənt/ (n. 退休) Plans.' This isn't abstract. **Civilian** /səˈvɪliən/ (n. 平民) families are losing their livelihoods because we treat nature **like** it has infinite reserves."

One advisor interrupted. "But economic growth has been **viable** /ˈvaɪəbl/ (adj. 可行的). We can't impose **sanction**-s /ˈsæŋkʃn/ (n. 制裁) on businesses." Maya felt frustration rise. "With respect, that **outlook** /ˈaʊtlʊk/ (n. 前景) is short-sighted. Let me give you some **advice** /ədˈvaɪs/ (n. 建议): **clever** /ˈklevər/ (adj. 聪明的) policies can balance both. Other states have done it."

The **governor** leaned forward. "What do you propose?" Maya's fingers moved quickly, bringing up charts. "A **technical** framework that doesn't **exclude** small businesses but encourages transition. I've worn this old **t-shirt** for a reason—it's from a solar company that started with three people and now employs hundreds. They didn't need massive capital, just smart policy."

She pointed to her **sock** /sɑːk/ (n. 袜子) —mismatched, with a hole. "I know I don't **look** **like** the typical consultant. But sometimes the **average** person sees solutions that experts miss. We need to **deal** with this now, not **under** pressure of future crisis."

The room fell silent. Then the **governor** spoke. "You've made your case. Let's explore this framework. But understand—any **sanction** must be fair." Maya nodded. "I'm not here to shame anyone. I just want a **viable** future where our **ecosystem** and our economy work together."

As she left, an advisor caught up with her. "That was brave. Here's my card—I **like** your **outlook**." Maya smiled, tucking the card into her pocket next to her grandmother's lucky **sock** charm. Change was possible. Sometimes **it** just took someone willing to speak truth **in** a room full of power.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

七点整,玛雅走进州议会大厦,穿着简单的T恤和牛仔裤——就像任何其他年轻的技术顾问,只是她不是来推销软件的。她是来就威胁她家乡的生态系统危机作证的。

州长坐在前面,两旁是顾问,他们似乎对保险文件比环境报告更感兴趣。玛雅感到一阵羞愧——不是为自己,而是为一个可以排除紧急声音的系统。

"你的意图是什么?"州长问道,他的语气暗示她应该快速处理她的发言。玛雅深吸一口气开始了。"我的意图是提及你可能在不同情况下看到的数据。这不仅仅是污染问题——而是关于我们的民主责任。"

她拿出笔记本电脑。"让我给你看上周的头条:'生态系统崩溃威胁普通家庭的退休计划。'这不是抽象的。平民家庭正在失去生计,因为我们把自然当作有无限储备的东西。"

一位顾问打断了。"但经济增长一直是可行的。我们不能对企业实施制裁。"玛雅感到沮丧上升。"恕我直言,那种前景是短视的。让我给你一些建议:聪明的政策可以平衡两者。其他州已经做到了。"

州长身体前倾。"你提议什么?"玛雅的手指快速移动,调出图表。"一个不排除小企业但鼓励转型的技术框架。我穿这件旧T恤是有原因的——它来自一家从三个人开始的太阳能公司,现在雇用数百人。他们不需要大量资本,只需要明智的政策。"

她指着她的袜子——不配对,还有一个洞。"我知道我看起来不像典型的顾问。但有时候普通人能看到专家错过的解决方案。我们需要现在就处理这个问题,而不是在未来危机的压力下。"

房间陷入沉默。然后州长说话了。"你已经陈述了你的理由。让我们探讨这个框架。但要明白——任何制裁都必须公平。"玛雅点点头。"我不是来羞辱任何人的。我只想要一个我们的生态系统和经济共同运作的可行未来。"

当她离开时,一位顾问追上了她。"那很勇敢。这是我的名片——我喜欢你的前景。"玛雅微笑着,把名片塞进口袋,旁边是她祖母的幸运袜子护身符。改变是可能的。有时候它只需要有人愿意在充满权力的房间里说出真相。

**原句:** "...wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans—like any other young technical consultant, except she wasn't here to sell software."

**分析:** 破折号引出比较,"like" 表示"像",建立相似性。"except" 引出转折,说明不同之处。

**亮点:** 通过外表的相似与目的的不同形成对比,突出人物的独特使命。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "This isn't just an issue of pollution—it's about our democratic responsibility."

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "like" 作介词 vs. 连词

**原句:** "...wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans—like any other young technical consultant."

**聚焦:** "like" 作介词,表示"像...一样"

**用法说明:**
"Like" 可以作介词(后接名词)或动词(表示喜欢)。在正式写作中,当要引导从句时,应该用 "as" 而不是 "like"。但作介词时,"like" 是正确的选择。

**Like vs. As:**
- Like + 名词/代词: "She looks like her mother."
- As + 从句: "Do as I say, not as I do."
- 口语中 like 常替代 as: "It happened like I told you." (非正式)

**更多例句:**
- "He runs like the wind." (介词)
- "Like many students, she works part-time." (介词)
- "I like chocolate." (动词)

**可替换句:** "...as any other young technical consultant would dress." (用 as 引导从句,更正式)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "except" 引导转折

**原句:** "...like any other young technical consultant, except she wasn't here to sell software."

**聚焦:** "except" 用作连词,引出例外或转折

**用法说明:**
"Except" 通常作介词(意为"除了"),但也可以作连词引导从句,表示"只是;但是"。这种用法在描述相似中的不同时特别有效。

**Except 用法:**
- 作介词: "Everyone came except John."
- 作连词: "The plan is good, except (that) it costs too much."
- 与 but 对比: "except" 更强调例外,"but" 更一般性

**更多例句:**
- "She looks the same, except her hair is shorter."
- "It's perfect, except it's too expensive."

**可替换句:** "...like any other young technical consultant, but she wasn't here to sell software." (用 but,较常见)
