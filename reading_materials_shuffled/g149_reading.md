**#TechAndFuture** – A Vision for Tomorrow

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Maya had a **vision** /ˈvɪʒn/ (n. 视力；愿景) that wouldn't let her rest. As she walked through the city's **parking** /ˈpɑːrkɪŋ/ (n. 停车) lot, she saw the problem clearly: **multiple** /ˈmʌltɪpl/ (adj. 多个的；多重的) empty spaces where affordable **housing** /ˈhaʊzɪŋ/ (n. 住房；住宅) could **be** /biː/ (v. 是；存在). The **publication** /ˌpʌblɪˈkeɪʃn/ (n. 出版；出版物) she worked for had asked her to write about urban **processing** /ˈprɑːsesɪŋ/ (n. 处理；加工) of resources, **but** she wanted to **approach** /əˈproʊtʃ/ (v./n. 接近；方法) it differently.

"The **consideration** /kənˌsɪdəˈreɪʃn/ (n. 考虑；体贴) shouldn't just **be** /biː/ (v. 是) economic," she told her editor. "We need to **compare** /kəmˈper/ (v. 比较；对比) different models of development." Her editor, a **sharp** /ʃɑːrp/ (adj. 锐利的；敏锐的) woman with years of experience, nodded. "What's your **sole** /soʊl/ (adj. 唯一的；单独的) focus?"

Maya explained her plan. She wanted to interview people with **diabetes** /ˌdaɪəˈbiːtiːz/ (n. 糖尿病) and other chronic conditions who couldn't afford **expensive** /ɪkˈspensɪv/ (adj. 昂贵的) care because their **housing** costs were too high. The **cooperation** /koʊˌɑːpəˈreɪʃn/ (n. 合作) between health and **housing** sectors was **cool** /kuːl/ (adj. 酷的；凉爽的), **but** underfunded. She'd document the **fate** /feɪt/ (n. 命运；fate) of those caught **in** this crisis.

Over the next month, Maya conducted **multiple** interviews. One man told her how the **counter** /ˈkaʊntər/ (n. 柜台；计数器) at the pharmacy always showed amounts he couldn't pay. A woman described how she had to **screw** /skruː/ (v. 拧紧；欺骗；n. 螺丝钉) together **multiple** part-time jobs just to afford rent. The **arrangement** /əˈreɪndʒmənt/ (n. 安排；布置) of their lives left no room for health.

Maya's article sparked debate. She wrote: "This isn't about **donation** /doʊˈneɪʃn/ (n. 捐赠；捐款)-s or charity. It's about **permanent** /ˈpɜːrmənənt/ (adj. 永久的；长期的) structural change. We **require** /rɪˈkwaɪr/ (v. 需要；要求) **cooperation** from **multiple** sectors. We must not **exploit** /ɪkˈsplɔɪt/ (v. 剥削；利用) the vulnerable **by** keeping **housing** **expensive** and care out of **reach** /riːtʃ/ (n. 范围；v. 到达)."

The **publication** went viral. City officials called her. "We want your **input** /ˈɪnpʊt/ (n. 输入；意见)," they said. Maya took a deep **breath** /breθ/ (n. 呼吸). Her **vision** was becoming reality. She remembered what her professor used to say: "A single voice can **drive** /draɪv/ (v. 驾驶；驱使) change if it speaks truth." Maya smiled. Her work had just begun.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

玛雅有一个让她无法安息的愿景。当她走过城市的停车场时,她清楚地看到了问题:多个可以建造经济适用住房的空地。她工作的出版社要求她写关于城市资源处理的文章,但她想用不同的方法来处理它。

"考虑不应该只是经济性的,"她告诉她的编辑。"我们需要比较不同的发展模式。"她的编辑,一位有多年经验的敏锐女性,点了点头。"你唯一的关注点是什么?"

玛雅解释了她的计划。她想采访那些患有糖尿病和其他慢性疾病的人,他们因为住房成本太高而无法负担昂贵的医疗。卫生和住房部门之间的合作很酷,但资金不足。她会记录那些陷入这场危机的人的命运。

接下来的一个月里,玛雅进行了多次采访。一个男人告诉她,药房的柜台总是显示他无法支付的金额。一位女士描述了她如何不得不拼凑多份兼职工作才能负担租金。他们生活的安排没有给健康留下任何空间。

玛雅的文章引发了辩论。她写道:"这不是关于捐赠或慈善。这是关于永久性的结构性变革。我们需要多个部门的合作。我们不能通过保持住房昂贵和让医疗遥不可及来剥削弱势群体。"

这篇出版物疯传了。市政官员打电话给她。"我们想要你的意见,"他们说。玛雅深吸一口气。她的愿景正在成为现实。她记得她的教授过去常说的话:"如果说出真相,一个声音就能驱动变化。"玛雅笑了。她的工作才刚刚开始。

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The consideration shouldn't just be economic."

**分析:** "shouldn't just be" 表示"不应该只是...",强调还有其他重要因素。这种部分否定比完全否定更委婉、更准确。

**亮点:** 通过否定"仅仅是经济性"来暗示需要多维度考虑,这是学术和政策讨论中常用的修辞手法。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "We must not exploit the vulnerable by keeping housing expensive and care out of reach."

**分析:** "exploit sb. by doing" 表示"通过...来剥削某人"。"out of reach" 是习语,表示"够不着;遥不可及"。两个并列的动名词短语说明剥削的具体方式。

**亮点:** 这句话将抽象的社会问题具体化,明确指出了剥削的机制,具有很强的批判力度。

### 句子 3
**原句:** "A single voice can drive change if it speaks truth."

**分析:** 条件状语从句 "if it speaks truth" 说明产生影响的条件。"drive change" 是常用搭配,表示"推动变革"。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "not just...but (also)..." 结构

**聚焦:** "not just...but (also)..." 部分否定结构

**用法说明:**
"not just...but (also)..." 表示"不仅...而且...",用于强调除了提到的内容外还有其他重要内容。这是一种递进关系,比简单的否定更有层次感。

**完整结构:**

"The consideration shouldn't just be economic, but also social."

**例句:**
- She's not just smart but also kind.
- Success requires not just talent but also hard work.

**可替换句:** "The consideration should be more than just economic."

### 聚焦点 2: "by doing" 表示方式

**原句:** "We must not exploit the vulnerable by keeping housing expensive and care out of reach."

**聚焦:** "by + 动名词" 表示方式或手段

**用法说明:**
"by + doing" 是表示"通过...方式"的常用结构。它回答"如何"的问题,说明动作完成的方式或手段。注意 "by" 后面必须用动名词(V-ing)形式。

**例句:**
- She improved her English by reading books.
- They succeeded by working together.
- You can save money by cooking at home.

**对比:**
