## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **local** /ˈloʊkl/ (adj. 本地的) **movie** /ˈmuːvi/ (n. 电影) theater had seen better days. Its **venue** /ˈvenjuː/ (n. 场地) was small, paint peeling from the walls, but it held a special place in the hearts of the neighborhood. Nina, who lived in the **residence** /ˈrezɪdəns/ (n. 住所) above the theater, had just been named the new manager. Her first task: save the place from closing.

"**Yeah** /jeə/ (interj. 是的)," she told her **champion** /ˈtʃæmpiən/ (n. 冠军) friend Tom, a **defender** /dɪˈfendər/ (n. 捍卫者) of old buildings, "I know it's a **routine** /ruːˈtiːn/ (n. 常规) challenge. But we need to **reach** /riːtʃ/ (v. 达到) more people. The **balance** /ˈbæləns/ (n. 平衡) between keeping history and making it **effective** /ɪˈfektɪv/ (adj. 有效的) is hard."

**Fortunately** /ˈfɔːrtʃənətli/ (adv. 幸运地), Nina had a plan. She would organize a film festival—not just showing old classics but also featuring **local** **work** /wɜːrk/ (n. 作品) from young directors. The **meantime** /ˈmiːntaɪm/ (n. 其间), she **blocked** /blɑːkt/ (v. 阻挡) off two weeks to prepare. Each **segment** /ˈseɡmənt/ (n. 部分) of the program was carefully chosen.

"What about the **critique** /krɪˈtiːk/ (n. 批评)?" asked an elderly **listener** /ˈlɪsənər/ (n. 听众), Mrs. Santos. "Some might say old theaters are not worth saving." Nina smiled. "Then we'll show them. This place is like a **saint** /seɪnt/ (n. 圣人)—quiet but powerful. It has given people joy in the **midst** /mɪdst/ (n. 中间) of hard times."

On opening night, the **block** /blɑːk/ (n. 街区) was alive with energy. People brought food—fresh **turkey** /ˈtɜːrki/ (n. 火鸡), bread, and desserts—to share. The smell and **taste** /teɪst/ (n. 味道) of home cooking filled the air. Nina stood at the entrance, welcoming everyone. "In the **meantime**, while we wait for the show to start, let me give you **recognition** /ˌrekəɡˈnɪʃn/ (n. 认可) of our volunteers who made this happen."

Inside, the first film began. It was a story about a family learning to **accomplish** /əˈkɑːmplɪʃ/ (v. 完成) their dreams against all odds. The crowd was silent, moved by the story. Then came the **shock** /ʃɑːk/ (n. 震惊)—the director was a teenager from three blocks away. The applause was thunderous. Nina felt tears in her eyes. They had done it. The theater wasn't just saved—it was reborn.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

这家本地电影院曾有过更好的日子。它的场地很小,墙上的油漆剥落,但它在街区居民心中占有特殊的位置。住在电影院楼上的妮娜刚被任命为新经理。她的第一个任务:拯救这个地方免于关闭。

"是的,"她告诉她的冠军朋友汤姆,一位老建筑的捍卫者,"我知道这是一个常规的挑战。但我们需要接触更多人。在保持历史和使其有效之间保持平衡是困难的。"

幸运的是,妮娜有一个计划。她将组织一个电影节——不仅展示老经典,还展出年轻导演的本地作品。与此同时,她留出两周时间来准备。节目的每个部分都经过精心选择。

"那批评呢?"一位年长的听众桑托斯夫人问。"有些人可能会说老剧院不值得拯救。"妮娜笑了。"那么我们就展示给他们看。这个地方就像一位圣人——安静但强大。它在困难时期给了人们快乐。"

在开幕之夜,这个街区充满了活力。人们带来食物——新鲜的火鸡、面包和甜点——分享。家常菜的气味和味道充满了空气。妮娜站在入口处,欢迎每个人。"与此同时,在我们等待演出开始的时候,让我向促成这一切的志愿者们表示认可。"

在里面,第一部电影开始了。这是一个关于一个家庭学习克服一切困难完成梦想的故事。人群安静了,被故事感动了。然后震惊来了——导演是三个街区外的一个青少年。掌声雷动。妮娜感到眼中含泪。他们做到了。这家电影院不仅被拯救了——它重生了。
