## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **boom** /buːm/ (n. 繁荣；隆隆声) of thunder woke Marcus at dawn. He sat up in bed, feeling the **thin** /θɪn/ (adj. 薄的；瘦的) blanket slip from his shoulders. Today was the day his **brand** /brænd/ (n. 品牌；商标) would launch at the tech fair. The **complex** /ˈkɑːmpleks/ (adj. 复杂的) system he had built over two years would finally reach the world.

His **husband** /ˈhʌzbənd/ (n. 丈夫), Daniel, was already awake, setting up breakfast. "You'll be a great **host** /hoʊst/ (n. 主人；主持人) today," Daniel said with a smile. Marcus nodded, though he felt **afraid** /əˈfreɪd/ (adj. 害怕的). The fair would bring a **variety** /vəˈraɪəti/ (n. 多样性；种类) of investors, and he needed to **balance** /ˈbæləns/ (v. 平衡) confidence with honesty.

At the convention center, Marcus stood near his booth at the **port** /pɔːrt/ (n. 港口；端口) district. His device could **detect** /dɪˈtekt/ (v. 发现；探测) **electrical** /ɪˈlektrɪkl/ (adj. 电的) signals with amazing accuracy. A small **drum** /drʌm/ (n. 鼓；桶) -shaped sensor formed its core. The **output** /ˈaʊtpʊt/ (n. 产量；输出) was displayed on a screen **somewhat** /ˈsʌmwʌt/ (adv. 有点；稍微) like a radar.

A woman approached. "What **land** /lænd/ (n. 土地；陆地) -based applications does this have?" she asked. Marcus explained his vision: helping farmers **overcome** /ˌoʊvərˈkʌm/ (v. 克服；战胜) soil problems by measuring underground water. The **increasing** /ɪnˈkriːsɪŋ/ (adj. 增加的) need for smart farming made his invention valuable.

**Importantly** /ɪmˈpɔːrtntli/ (adv. 重要地), he didn't want to **consume** /kənˈsuːm/ (v. 消耗；消费) too much power. His **grandfather** /ˈɡrænfɑːðər/ (n. 祖父) had been a farmer, and Marcus remembered the old man's words: "**Promise** /ˈprɑːmɪs/ (v. 承诺；n. 诺言) only what you can deliver."

Suddenly, a child nearby began to **scream** /skriːm/ (v. 尖叫；n. 尖叫声). Marcus turned to see the boy pointing at his display. "Look at the colors!" the child shouted with joy. The crowd grew. Questions flew. By noon, three investors had expressed interest. Marcus felt relief wash over him.

That evening, Daniel met him outside. "Did they **condemn** /kənˈdem/ (v. 谴责；宣判) your idea?" he asked nervously. Marcus laughed. "No, quite the opposite. They loved it." As they walked through the **area** /ˈeriə/ (n. 区域；领域), Marcus realized he had found more than success—he had found his voice.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

雷声的轰鸣在黎明时分惊醒了马库斯。他在床上坐起，感觉薄薄的毯子从肩膀上滑落。今天是他的品牌在科技展上发布的日子。他花了两年时间构建的复杂系统终于要面向世界了。

他的丈夫丹尼尔已经醒了，正在准备早餐。"今天你会是个出色的主持人，"丹尼尔微笑着说。马库斯点点头，尽管他感到害怕。展会将带来各种各样的投资者，他需要在自信和诚实之间保持平衡。

在会议中心，马库斯站在港口区的展位旁。他的设备可以以惊人的准确度探测电信号。一个小鼓形传感器构成了它的核心。输出显示在屏幕上，有点像雷达。

一位女士走过来。"这在陆地上有什么应用？"她问。马库斯解释了他的愿景：通过测量地下水帮助农民克服土壤问题。对智能农业日益增长的需求使他的发明很有价值。

重要的是，他不想消耗太多能源。他的祖父曾是一名农民，马库斯记得老人的话："只承诺你能做到的事。"

突然，附近的一个孩子开始尖叫。马库斯转身看到男孩指着他的显示器。"看那些颜色！"孩子兴奋地喊道。人群聚集起来。问题接连不断。到中午时，已经有三位投资者表示了兴趣。马库斯感到如释重负。

那天晚上，丹尼尔在外面接他。"他们谴责你的想法了吗？"他紧张地问。马库斯笑了。"没有，恰恰相反。他们很喜欢。"当他们走过这个区域时，马库斯意识到他找到的不仅仅是成功——他找到了自己的声音。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The complex system he had built over two years would finally reach the world."

**分析:** 这是一个含有定语从句的复杂句。"he had built over two years"是定语从句，修饰"system"。过去完成时（had built）表示在故事主线之前完成的动作，"would"表示过去将来时，强调在过去某个时间点看未来。

**亮点:** 时态层次丰富，展现了动作的时间顺序和因果关系。

### 句子 2
**原句:** "He needed to balance confidence with honesty."

**分析:** "balance A with B"是固定搭配，表示"在A和B之间取得平衡"。这个结构简洁有力，用抽象名词（confidence, honesty）作宾语，体现了内心冲突。

**亮点:** 用简单结构表达深刻的心理状态，适合学习者模仿。

### 句子 3
**原句:** "The increasing need for smart farming made his invention valuable."

**分析:** 这是一个简单句，但包含了动名词短语"increasing need"作主语。"make + 宾语 + 形容词"结构表示"使...变得..."。

**亮点:** 展示了如何用形容词修饰抽象名词来增加表达的层次感。

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Promise only what you can deliver."

**分析:** 这是一个祈使句，包含宾语从句"what you can deliver"。"what"在从句中充当宾语，整个从句作"promise"的宾语。

**亮点:** 简短有力的格言式表达，适合用于建议和警告。

### 句子 5
**原句:** "Marcus realized he had found more than success—he had found his voice."

**分析:** 破折号用于强调和解释。"more than"表示"不仅仅是"。两个"had found"形成对比和递进，第二个通过"his voice"这个隐喻表达了更深层的成长。

**亮点:** 使用破折号和隐喻，使结尾富有文学性和启发性。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦（Grammar Focus）

### 焦点 1: 过去完成时的使用

**原句:** "The complex system he had built over two years would finally reach the world."

**聚焦:** 过去完成时 (had + past participle)

**用法:** 在过去的叙事中，表示在故事主线时间点之前已经完成的动作。这里"had built"发生在"would reach"之前，建立了清晰的时间层次。

**可替换句:** "He spent two years building the complex system, and now it would reach the world."

**区别:** 替换句用了简单过去时，虽然意思相近，但时间层次感不如原句清晰。

### 焦点 2: 情态动词 + have done

**原句:** "Three investors had expressed interest."

**聚焦:** 过去完成时在叙事中标记重要的完成状态

**用法:** 用于强调在故事某个时间点之前已经达成的结果，这个结果对当前情节有影响。

**可替换句:** "Three investors expressed interest by that time."

**区别:** 加入"by that time"可以部分替代过去完成时的功能，但不如原句简洁自然。
