## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Dr. Kim stood at the **beginning** /bɪˈɡɪnɪŋ/ (n. 开始) of what would be a life-changing conversation. Her patient, Marcus, sat across from her, wearing faded **jeans** /dʒiːnz/ (n. 牛仔裤) and an old jacket. At forty-five, he looked older, tired. The **intense** /ɪnˈtens/ (adj. 强烈的;紧张的) pain in his chest had finally brought him to the clinic.

"Your **cholesterol** /kəˈlestərɔːl/ (n. 胆固醇) is very **high** /haɪ/ (adj. 高的)," Dr. Kim said gently. "And your blood pressure shows you're at risk. We need to talk about your **diet** /ˈdaɪət/ (n. 饮食) and lifestyle." She watched his face, knowing this **concern** /kənˈsɜːrn/ (n./v. 关心;担心) might not be welcome.

Marcus had always **prefer** /prɪˈfɜːr/ (v. 更喜欢;宁愿) to ignore health problems. "I don't have time for **surgery** /ˈsɜːrdʒəri/ (n. 手术)," he said quickly. "Or **dramatic** /drəˈmætɪk/ (adj. 戏剧性的;显著的) changes. Can't you just give me pills?"

"Pills can help," Dr. Kim replied, "but they're not everything. The changes I'm suggesting are **mild** /maɪld/ (adj. 温和的;轻微的), not **dramatic** /drəˈmætɪk/ (adj. 戏剧性的). **Keep** /kiːp/ (v. 保持;保留) walking daily, eat less fried food. Nothing **intense** /ɪnˈtens/ (adj. 极端的)."

Marcus looked down at his **jeans** /dʒiːnz/ (n. 牛仔裤), worn at the knees. He worked as a truck driver, a **longtime** /ˈlɔːŋtaɪm/ (adj. 长期的) job that **mean** /miːn/ (v. 意味着) sitting for hours. His **ethnic** /ˈeθnɪk/ (adj. 种族的;民族的) community had traditions of heavy meals—his grandmother had been a wonderful cook. But now those traditions might **mean** /miːn/ (v. 意味着) an early death.

"I'm **hungry** /ˈhʌŋɡri/ (adj. 饥饿的) all the time," Marcus said. "If I change my **diet** /ˈdaɪət/ (n. 饮食), I'll be even more **hungry** /ˈhʌŋɡri/ (adj. 饥饿的)."

Dr. Kim pulled out a **petition** /pəˈtɪʃn/ (n. 请愿书) she had signed recently, advocating for better food education in schools. "This isn't about starving yourself," she explained. "It's about **dignity** /ˈdɪɡnəti/ (n. 尊严) and self-care. You deserve to **keep** /kiːp/ (v. 保持) your health."

She showed him pictures of healthy meals. "You can still **fit** /fɪt/ (v./adj. 适合;健康的) your **ethnic** /ˈeθnɪk/ (adj. 民族的) foods into a healthy plan. **Flip** /flɪp/ (v. 翻转) the way you think about eating. Instead of food being entertainment, make it fuel."

Marcus listened, but his **concern** /kənˈsɜːrn/ (n. 担心) showed on his face. "What about my job? I'm **passing** /ˈpæsɪŋ/ (v. 经过;通过) restaurants all day. The smell alone makes me **hungry** /ˈhʌŋɡri/ (adj. 饥饿的)."

"**Invest** /ɪnˈvest/ (v. 投资) in a good lunch box," Dr. Kim suggested. "Pack your meals. I know it sounds **mild** /maɪld/ (adj. 简单的), but these **mild** /maɪld/ (adj. 轻微的) changes add up." She paused. "Think of your daughter. You told me she wants to have a family **rally** /ˈræli/ (n./v. 集会;团结) next summer. Don't you want to be there, healthy enough to **fly** /flaɪ/ (v. 飞行) across the country to see her?"

That hit home. Marcus's daughter lived far away, and he missed her terribly. He remembered carrying her on his shoulders when she was little, her small hands holding onto his **trunk** /trʌŋk/ (n. 躯干;树干;后备箱)—his body that now betrayed him.

"The **queen** /kwiːn/ (n. 女王;王后) of England lived to old age by taking care of herself," Dr. Kim said with a **mild** /maɪld/ (adj. 温和的) smile. "You're not royalty, but you deserve a **longtime** /ˈlɔːŋtaɪm/ (adj. 长久的) healthy life too."

Over the next months, Marcus made changes. They weren't **dramatic** /drəˈmætɪk/ (adj. 戏剧性的), but they were real. He would **flip** /flɪp/ (v. 翻转) eggs instead of frying them in oil. He learned to **keep** /kiːp/ (v. 保持) healthy snacks in his truck's **trunk** /trʌŋk/ (n. 后备箱). When he felt **hungry** /ˈhʌŋɡri/ (adj. 饥饿的) **passing** /ˈpæsɪŋ/ (prep. 经过) fast food places, he thought about **dignity** /ˈdɪɡnəti/ (n. 尊严)—treating his body with respect.

His **cholesterol** /kəˈlestərɔːl/ (n. 胆固醇) dropped. The **intense** /ɪnˈtens/ (adj. 强烈的) chest pain faded. At his next visit, Dr. Kim noted he looked younger. "You **fit** /fɪt/ (v. 适合) into those **jeans** /dʒiːnz/ (n. 牛仔裤) **better** /ˈbetər/ (adv. 更好地) now," she observed.

Marcus laughed. "I might **invest** /ɪnˈvest/ (v. 投资) in new ones. These are **passing** /ˈpæsɪŋ/ (adj. 过时的) their prime." He pulled out his phone, showing a picture of the family **rally** /ˈræli/ (n. 集会) invitation. "And I'm going to **fly** /flaɪ/ (v. 飞) there, healthy and ready."

From the **beginning** /bɪˈɡɪnɪŋ/ (n. 开始), Dr. Kim had known that **concern** /kənˈsɜːrn/ (n. 关心) alone wouldn't change a patient. What worked was showing them what they could **keep** /kiːp/ (v. 保留)—time, family, **dignity** /ˈdɪɡnəti/ (n. 尊严)—if they chose to care for themselves. The **queen** /kwiːn/ (n. 女王) of one's own health wasn't born; she was built, one **mild** /maɪld/ (adj. 温和的) choice at a time. And Marcus had become the **king** /kɪŋ/ (n. 国王) of his own **ethnic** /ˈeθnɪk/ (adj. 民族的) kitchen, proving that transformation didn't need to be **dramatic** /drəˈmætɪk/ (adj. 戏剧性的) to be real.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

金医生站在一场改变生活的对话开始之处。她的病人马库斯坐在她对面,穿着褪色的牛仔裤和一件旧夹克。四十五岁的他看起来更老,更疲惫。胸口的强烈疼痛终于把他带到了诊所。

"你的胆固醇非常高,"金医生温和地说。"而且你的血压显示你有风险。我们需要谈谈你的饮食和生活方式。"她观察着他的脸,知道这种关心可能不受欢迎。

马库斯一直更喜欢忽视健康问题。"我没时间做手术,"他快速说道。"或者戏剧性的改变。你不能只给我药片吗?"

"药片可以帮助,"金医生回答,"但它们不是一切。我建议的改变是温和的,不是戏剧性的。保持每天散步,少吃油炸食品。没什么极端的。"

马库斯低头看着他的牛仔裤,膝盖处已经磨损。他是一名卡车司机,这份长期工作意味着要坐很多小时。他的民族社区有吃大餐的传统——他的祖母曾是一位出色的厨师。但现在这些传统可能意味着早逝。

"我总是饿,"马库斯说。"如果我改变饮食,我会更饿。"

金医生拿出一份她最近签署的请愿书,倡导在学校开展更好的食品教育。"这不是让你饿肚子,"她解释道。"这关乎尊严和自我照顾。你值得保持健康。"

她给他看了健康饮食的图片。"你仍然可以让你的民族食物适应健康计划。翻转你对吃的想法。不要把食物当成娱乐,而是当成燃料。"

马库斯在听,但他的担忧显露在脸上。"那我的工作呢?我整天经过餐馆。光是气味就让我饿。"

"投资一个好饭盒,"金医生建议。"自己打包饭菜。我知道这听起来很简单,但这些轻微的改变会累积起来。"她停顿了一下。"想想你的女儿。你告诉我她想在明年夏天举办家庭集会。你不想健康地在那里,能飞越全国去看她吗?"

这话击中了要害。马库斯的女儿住在很远的地方,他非常想念她。他记得小时候把她扛在肩上,她的小手抓着他的躯干——那个现在背叛了他的身体。

"英国女王通过照顾自己活到了老年,"金医生带着温和的微笑说。"你不是皇室成员,但你也值得拥有长久的健康生活。"

在接下来的几个月里,马库斯做出了改变。它们不是戏剧性的,但它们是真实的。他会翻炒鸡蛋而不是在油里煎。他学会在卡车后备箱里放健康零食。当他经过快餐店感到饥饿时,他想到尊严——尊重地对待自己的身体。

他的胆固醇下降了。强烈的胸痛消退了。在下次就诊时,金医生注意到他看起来更年轻了。"你现在更合身地穿这些牛仔裤了,"她观察道。

马库斯笑了。"我可能会投资买新的。这些已经过了最好的时候。"他拿出手机,展示家庭集会的邀请照片。"我会飞到那里,健康而且准备好。"

从一开始,金医生就知道仅仅关心不会改变病人。有效的是向他们展示如果选择照顾自己,他们能保留什么——时间、家人、尊严。自己健康的女王不是天生的;她是建立的,一次一个温和的选择。马库斯已经成为自己民族厨房的国王,证明转变不需要戏剧性才能真实。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "At forty-five, he looked older, tired."

**分析:** 这是一个简洁的描述性句子。"At forty-five" 是介词短语作状语,说明年龄。主句非常简短,"looked" 后接两个形容词 "older" 和 "tired" 作表语,中间用逗号隔开。这种省略连词的并列形式在文学写作中很常见,能创造停顿感和节奏感。

**亮点:** 通过简短有力的形容词并列,快速勾勒人物形象,让读者立即对主人公的状态有直观印象。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Flip the way you think about eating. Instead of food being entertainment, make it fuel."

**分析:** 第一句使用祈使句,"the way you think about eating" 是宾语,其中包含定语从句。第二句使用 "instead of...make..." 结构,对比两种不同的思维方式。"food being entertainment" 是动名词的复合结构。

**亮点:** 通过"翻转思维"的隐喻和"娱乐 vs. 燃料"的对比,生动传达了饮食观念的转变,是很好的说服性表达。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "That hit home."

**分析:** 这是一个简短但意义深刻的句子。"hit home" 是习语,意为"击中要害、触动内心"。"That" 指代前面医生提到的关于女儿的话。这种短句的使用能够增强情感冲击力。

**亮点:** 在长句之后使用极短的句子,形成节奏上的对比,强调情感转折点,是高级写作技巧。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "The queen of one's own health wasn't born; she was built, one mild choice at a time."

**分析:** 这是一个哲理性的总结句,使用拟人化和隐喻。"wasn't born...was built" 形成对比,强调健康是后天建立的。分号连接两个独立句子。"one mild choice at a time" 作方式状语,强调渐进性。

**亮点:** 通过 "queen" 的隐喻和 "born vs. built" 的对比,升华主题,给读者留下深刻印象,是典型的格言式结尾。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 动名词的复合结构

**原句:** "Instead of food being entertainment, make it fuel."

**聚焦:** 动名词复合结构 "food being entertainment"

**用法说明:** 
动名词的复合结构由"名词/代词 + 动名词"组成,表示动作的执行者和动作本身。在 "food being entertainment" 中,"food" 是逻辑主语,"being" 是动名词。这种结构常用在介词(如 instead of, without, upon等)之后。

**结构分析:**
- Instead of (介词短语)
- food being entertainment (动名词复合结构)
  - food: 逻辑主语
  - being: 动名词
  - entertainment: 表语

**可替换句:** "Instead of treating food as entertainment, make it fuel." (使用动名词短语,意思相同但结构不同)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 分号的使用

**原句:** "The queen of one's own health wasn't born; she was built, one mild choice at a time."

**聚焦:** 分号(;)连接两个独立句子

**用法说明:**
分号可以连接两个语法上独立但逻辑上紧密相关的句子。这里两个句子形成对比关系("wasn't born" vs. "was built"),用分号比用句号更能体现它们之间的紧密联系,比用连词更简洁有力。

**结构分析:**
- 第一个独立句: The queen of one's own health wasn't born
- 分号: ;
- 第二个独立句: she was built, one mild choice at a time

**可替换句:** 
1. "The queen of one's own health wasn't born, but she was built, one mild choice at a time." (用连词 "but",更明确但不如分号简洁)
2. "The queen of one's own health wasn't born. She was built, one mild choice at a time." (用句号,但失去了两句间的紧密联系感)
