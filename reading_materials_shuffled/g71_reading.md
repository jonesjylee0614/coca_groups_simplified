## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **camera** /ˈkæmərə/ (n. 照相机) felt heavy in Emma's hands. She had been sent **to** /tuː/ (prep. 到) the **trading** /ˈtreɪdɪŋ/ (adj. 贸易的) district by her boss, who would **oversee** /ˌoʊvərˈsiː/ (v. 监督) the project from the office. The **demand** /dɪˈmænd/ (n. 需求) for fresh stories was high. **Generally** /ˈdʒenərəli/ (adv. 通常) she felt confident, but today something was different. The air felt **harsh** /hɑːrʃ/ (adj. 严酷的), and she saw a **wave** /weɪv/ (n. 波浪) of people rush past her.

"Stay **around** /əˈraʊnd/ (adv. 在附近) here," her **chief** /tʃiːf/ (n. 主管) had said. "The **mall** /mɔːl/ (n. 购物中心) will be busy. Get me something real." Emma held her **hand** /hænd/ (n. 手) steady as she walked through the **arena** /əˈriːnə/ (n. 场地) where a protest was building. The **heat** /hiːt/ (n. 热量) from the crowd made her nervous. She checked her watch—**attendance** /əˈtendəns/ (n. 出席) was growing by the minute.

**Soon** /suːn/ (adv. 很快) she spotted a woman wearing a long **skirt** /skɜːrt/ (n. 裙子) standing alone near a **charter** /ˈtʃɑːrtər/ (n. 宪章) board. The woman looked tired. "Why are you here?" Emma asked. "Because injustice will never **cease** /siːs/ (v. 停止) unless we fight," she replied. "My **brain** /breɪn/ (n. 大脑) tells me to go home, but my heart says stay." Emma raised her camera, but **sadly** /ˈsædli/ (adv. 悲伤地), before she could take the shot, a **bullet** /ˈbʊlɪt/ (n. 子弹) flew past them.

The woman grabbed Emma's arm. "Run!" They ran toward a fruit stand where an old man was selling an **apple** /ˈæpl/ (n. 苹果). "Hide here," he said. The moment felt **eternal** /ɪˈtɜːrnl/ (adj. 永恒的), as if time had stopped. Emma's camera was still rolling. She captured the fear, the courage, the **equally** /ˈiːkwəli/ (adv. 同样地) powerful hope in people's eyes.

Later, back at the office, her chief watched the footage. "This is it," he said. "This is what the world needs to see."

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

相机在艾玛手中感觉很重。她被老板派到贸易区,老板会在办公室监督这个项目。对新鲜故事的需求很高。通常她感到自信,但今天有些不同。空气感觉很严酷,她看到一波人从她身边冲过。

"待在附近,"她的主管说。"购物中心会很忙。给我找些真实的东西。" 艾玛稳住手,走过正在集结抗议的场地。人群的热量让她紧张。她看了看表——出席人数每分钟都在增长。

很快她发现一个穿着长裙的女人独自站在宪章板附近。那个女人看起来很累。"你为什么在这里?"艾玛问。"因为除非我们战斗,否则不公正永远不会停止,"她回答。"我的大脑告诉我回家,但我的心说留下。" 艾玛举起相机,但悲伤的是,在她能拍摄之前,一颗子弹从他们身边飞过。

那个女人抓住艾玛的手臂。"跑!" 他们跑向一个水果摊,一位老人在那里卖苹果。"藏在这里,"他说。那一刻感觉永恒,好像时间停止了。艾玛的相机还在录制。她捕捉到了恐惧、勇气,以及人们眼中同样强大的希望。

后来,回到办公室,她的主管看了录像。"就是这个,"他说。"这是世界需要看到的。"

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The demand for fresh stories was high."

**分析:** "demand for" 是固定搭配,表示"对...的需求"。形容词 fresh 修饰 stories,表示新鲜的、最新的故事。整个句子使用过去时,交代故事背景。

**亮点:** 简洁地交代了主人公工作的压力和背景,为后续情节做铺垫。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Because injustice will never cease unless we fight."

**分析:** unless 引导条件状语从句,表示"除非"。will never cease 使用将来时态,表示坚定的信念。这是直接引语,展现人物的决心。

**亮点:** 通过对话展现人物的价值观和勇气,增强故事的情感力量。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "My brain tells me to go home, but my heart says stay."

**分析:** brain 和 heart 形成对比,象征理智与情感的冲突。"tell sb to do" 和 "say + 句子" 是不同的表达方式。but 连接转折,体现内心挣扎。

**亮点:** 用拟人化的修辞手法,生动展现人物的内心冲突。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "The moment felt eternal, as if time had stopped."

**分析:** "as if" 引导方式状语从句,后接过去完成时 "had stopped",表示与现在事实相反的虚拟语气。eternal 形容词作表语,强调时间的凝固感。

**亮点:** 使用比喻和虚拟语气,营造紧张悬疑的氛围。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "demand for" 的用法

**原句:** "The demand for fresh stories was high."

**聚焦:** 名词短语 "demand for"

**用法说明:** 
"demand for + 名词" 表示"对...的需求"。demand 作名词时,常与介词 for 搭配使用。当 demand 作动词时,后面可以接 that 从句或 to do 结构。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: The demand (for fresh stories)
- 系动词: was
- 表语: high

**类似表达:**
- The need for change is urgent. (对变革的需求很迫切)
- There is a demand for better education. (有对更好教育的需求)
- The company demands that employees arrive on time. (公司要求员工准时到达)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "as if" 虚拟语气

**原句:** "The moment felt eternal, as if time had stopped."

**聚焦:** "as if" 引导的虚拟语气

**用法说明:**
"as if" (好像) 引导的从句常用虚拟语气,表示与事实相反的假设。当描述与现在事实相反时,从句用过去时;描述与过去事实相反时,从句用过去完成时。本句中,时间实际上没有停止,所以用 "had stopped"。

**时态对比:**
- 与现在相反: He acts as if he were rich. (他表现得好像很富有 - 实际不富)
- 与过去相反: She looked as if she had seen a ghost. (她看起来好像见到鬼了)
- 真实情况: It looks as if it will rain. (看起来要下雨了 - 可能真会下雨)

**可替换句:** The moment felt like it would last forever.
