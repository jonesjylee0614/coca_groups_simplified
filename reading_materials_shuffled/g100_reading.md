**#SliceOfLife** – A story of unexpected courage

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **passenger** /ˈpæsɪndʒər/ (n. 乘客) **inside** /ɪnˈsaɪd/ (prep./adv. 在...里面) the bus watched the city lights blur past the window. Sarah was a **female** /ˈfiːmeɪl/ (adj./n. 女性的;女性) journalist returning from an interview. Her **boss** /bɔːs/ (n. 老板) had asked her to **lead** /liːd/ (v. 带领;领导) a new project, and she felt a **sense** /sens/ (n. 感觉;意识) of pride mixed with nervousness.

As the bus stopped, a young woman climbed aboard, carrying what looked like a **pile** /paɪl/ (n. 堆;大量) of books. She was **bold** /boʊld/ (adj. 大胆的;勇敢的) enough to sit next to Sarah, despite the **only** /ˈoʊnli/ (adv. 仅仅;只) empty seats being at the back. "**Come** /kʌm/ (v. 来;到来) here often?" the stranger asked with a smile so **cute** /kjuːt/ (adj. 可爱的) that Sarah couldn't help but respond.

They began an **exchange** /ɪksˈtʃeɪndʒ/ (n./v. 交换;交流) of ideas. The young woman was a **volunteer** /ˌvɑːlənˈtɪr/ (n./v. 志愿者;自愿做) at a wildlife center. "We're trying to **grant** /ɡrænt/ (v./n. 授予;拨款) protection to endangered species," she explained. "Last week, we saved a **whale** /weɪl/ (n. 鲸鱼) that had beached itself. It was a **giant** /ˈdʒaɪənt/ (adj./n. 巨大的;巨人) creature, must have weighed several **pound** /paʊnd/ (n. 磅;英镑) thousands."

Sarah listened, feeling her journalist instincts awaken. This could be her story. "Would you **advocate** /ˈædvəkeɪt/ (v./n. 提倡;拥护者) for an article about your work?" she asked. The woman's face lit up. "That would be my **favorite** /ˈfeɪvərɪt/ (adj./n. 最喜欢的;特别喜爱的人或物) thing! Though I should warn you—the work is **partially** /ˈpɑːrʃəli/ (adv. 部分地;不完全地) funded, so we face constant challenges."

Sarah nodded, her mind already forming questions. She wanted to understand how they **absorb** /əbˈzɔːrb/ (v. 吸收;理解) the emotional weight of their work. There was no room for **speculation** /ˌspekjuˈleɪʃn/ (n. 推测;投机) here—only real stories of dedication.

When they reached Sarah's stop, she turned to leave but hesitated. "I'll write this story," she promised. "And I'll make sure people understand why we must **protest** /ˈproʊtest/ (n./v. 抗议;反对) against wildlife destruction." She quoted a **verse** /vɜːrs/ (n. 诗句;韵文) her grandmother once taught her: "In every **handful** /ˈhændfʊl/ (n. 一把;少数) of earth, there lives a world."

The young woman smiled. "You understand," she said simply. And in that moment, Sarah knew this wasn't just another assignment—it was a calling.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

公交车里的乘客透过窗户看着城市的灯光模糊地掠过。莎拉是一名女记者,刚从一次采访中返回。她的老板要求她领导一个新项目,她感到自豪和紧张交织。

公交车停下时,一位年轻女子上了车,手里抱着一堆像是书籍的东西。她很大胆地坐在莎拉旁边,尽管后面才是仅有的空座位。"经常来这里吗?"陌生人带着可爱的笑容问道,莎拉忍不住回应。

她们开始交流想法。这位年轻女子是野生动物中心的志愿者。"我们正努力为濒危物种提供保护,"她解释说。"上周,我们救了一头搁浅的鲸鱼。那是一个巨大的生物,一定有几千磅重。"

莎拉听着,感觉到自己的记者本能被唤醒。这可能就是她的故事。"你会支持写一篇关于你工作的文章吗?"她问道。女子的脸上露出光彩。"那将是我最喜欢的事!不过我应该警告你——这项工作只有部分资金支持,所以我们面临持续的挑战。"

莎拉点头,她的脑海中已经形成了问题。她想理解他们如何吸收工作的情感重量。这里没有推测的空间——只有真实的奉献故事。

当她们到达莎拉的站点时,她转身要离开但犹豫了。"我会写这个故事,"她承诺。"我会确保人们理解为什么我们必须抗议破坏野生动物。"她引用了祖母曾教给她的一句诗:"在每一把泥土中,都生活着一个世界。"

年轻女子微笑着。"你明白,"她简单地说。在那一刻,莎拉知道这不仅仅是另一项任务——这是一种使命。
