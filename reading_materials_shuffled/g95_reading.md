## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Emma's **eye** /aɪ/ (n. 眼睛) caught a **broken** /ˈbroʊkən/ (adj. 破碎的) window in the old building. She stood there **now** /naʊ/ (adv. 现在), remembering when this was the **center** /ˈsentər/ (n. 中心) of the community. Her **campaign** /kæmˈpeɪn/ (n. 运动) to save it had just **begin** /bɪˈɡɪn/ (v. 开始)ning. "**Up** /ʌp/ (adv. 向上)," she thought, "the only way is up from here."

The building's history was **rich** /rɪtʃ/ (adj. 丰富的). A **summary** /ˈsʌməri/ (n. 摘要) of records showed it had once housed a school where children learned to **spread** /spred/ (v. 传播) knowledge. But a **storm** /stɔːrm/ (n. 暴风雨) years ago had caused damage, and then came the **accusation** /ˌækjuˈzeɪʃn/ (n. 指控) that the **burning** /ˈbɜːrnɪŋ/ (adj. 燃烧的) of funds made repairs impossible. The **believer** /bɪˈliːvər/ (n. 信徒)s in the project had nearly given up.

Emma's vision was to **educate** /ˈedʒukeɪt/ (v. 教育) through **innovation** /ˌɪnəˈveɪʃn/ (n. 创新). She had an **appointment** /əˈpɔɪntmənt/ (n. 预约) with the mayor to discuss using the **garage** /ɡəˈrɑːʒ/ (n. 车库) area for a workshop. The idea seemed **unbelievable** /ˌʌnbɪˈliːvəbl/ (adj. 难以置信的) to some, but Emma was **ambitious** /æmˈbɪʃəs/ (adj. 有雄心的). "Don't **piss** /pɪs/ (v. 激怒) off the council," her friend warned. "Present it with **kind** /kaɪnd/ (adj. 善良的)ness and logic."

At the meeting, Emma described her **short-term** /ˌʃɔːrt ˈtɜːrm/ (adj. 短期的) plans. "This isn't about **happiness** /ˈhæpinəs/ (n. 幸福) alone," she said. "It's about giving our youth a **breast** /brest/ (n. 胸怀) full of hope. We can **twist** /twɪst/ (v. 扭转) this situation around." The mayor nodded. "You're a **talented** /ˈtæləntɪd/ (adj. 有才能的) advocate," he said. "Let's make this happen."

Emma left with renewed energy. The building would live again.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

艾玛的眼睛注意到旧建筑里一扇破碎的窗户。她现在站在那里,记得这里曾是社区的中心。她拯救它的运动刚刚开始。"向上,"她想,"从这里唯一的路就是向上。"

这座建筑的历史很丰富。记录摘要显示它曾经是一所学校,孩子们在那里学习传播知识。但多年前的一场暴风雨造成了破坏,然后出现了资金燃烧的指控,使维修变得不可能。该项目的信徒们几乎放弃了。

艾玛的愿景是通过创新来教育。她与市长有一个预约,讨论将车库区域用于工作坊。这个想法对一些人来说似乎难以置信,但艾玛很有雄心。"不要激怒议会,"她的朋友警告说。"用善意和逻辑来呈现。"

在会议上,艾玛描述了她的短期计划。"这不仅仅是关于幸福,"她说。"这是关于给我们的年轻人一个充满希望的胸怀。我们可以扭转这种局面。" 市长点头。"你是一位有才能的倡导者,"他说。"让我们实现这个目标。"

艾玛带着新的能量离开了。这座建筑将再次焕发生机。
