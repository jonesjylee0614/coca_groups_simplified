**#SliceOfLife** – A story of courage and truth

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **biological** /ˌbaɪəˈlɑːdʒɪkl/ (adj. 生物的) research center stood beside a quiet **creek** /kriːk/ (n. 小溪), where Maya worked **either** /ˈiːðər/ (det. 两者之一的) as a scientist or a guardian of nature—she never quite knew which. Her **primary** /ˈpraɪmeri/ (adj. 主要的) **function** /ˈfʌŋkʃn/ (n. 功能) was to **assess** /əˈses/ (v. 评估) water quality, but lately, she felt a **rage** /reɪdʒ/ (n. 愤怒) building inside her.

The corporation that funded her **work** /wɜːrk/ (n. 工作) had been dumping waste into the water **in** /ɪn/ (prep. 在...里) secret. Maya discovered this when she tried to **pull** /pʊl/ (v. 拉；拽) samples from the **source** /sɔːrs/ (n. 来源) upstream. A dark **streak** /striːk/ (n. 条纹) ran through the water like a scar. She wanted to **check** /tʃek/ (v. 检查) again, hoping she was wrong, but the evidence was **brutal** /ˈbruːtl/ (adj. 残酷的).

For days, Maya debated with herself. Should she **criticize** /ˈkrɪtɪsaɪz/ (v. 批评) the company publicly? Her **annual** /ˈænjuəl/ (adj. 年度的) review was coming up, and she feared losing her job. Yet every time she thought of staying silent, she remembered the **human** /ˈhjuːmən/ (adj. 人类的) cost—the families who might drink that water, the children who played by the creek.

One morning, she decided to act. Maya began to **construct** /kənˈstrʌkt/ (v. 建造) a detailed report, **slice** /slaɪs/ (n. 切片) by **slice** of data showing the contamination. She knew the **vendor** /ˈvendər/ (n. 供应商) wouldn't **receive** /rɪˈsiːv/ (v. 接收) it well, but she had no choice. She posted her findings on her **blog** /blɑːɡ/ (n. 博客), **highlight**-ing /ˈhaɪlaɪt/ (v. 强调) the most shocking facts.

The response was immediate. She received a **nomination** /ˌnɑːmɪˈneɪʃn/ (n. 提名) for a whistleblower award, but also threats from the company. They tried to **catch** /kætʃ/ (v. 抓住) her **in** legal traps, but Maya stood firm. The creek began to heal, and so did her conscience.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

生物研究中心坐落在一条安静的小溪旁,玛雅在那里工作——她从不太确定自己是科学家还是大自然的守护者。她的主要职能是评估水质,但最近,她感到一股愤怒在内心积聚。

资助她工作的公司一直在秘密向水中倾倒废物。当玛雅试图从上游的源头提取样本时发现了这一点。一道黑色的条纹像伤疤一样贯穿水面。她想再检查一次,希望自己错了,但证据是残酷的。

几天来,玛雅一直在心里挣扎。她应该公开批评这家公司吗?她的年度评审即将到来,她担心失去工作。然而每次她想保持沉默时,就会想起人类的代价——那些可能喝这水的家庭,在溪边玩耍的孩子们。

一天早晨,她决定采取行动。玛雅开始构建一份详细的报告,用一片片数据切片展示污染情况。她知道供应商不会很好地接收这份报告,但她别无选择。她在自己的博客上发布了调查结果,强调了最令人震惊的事实。

反响是立即的。她获得了举报人奖的提名,但也收到了来自公司的威胁。他们试图在法律陷阱中抓住她,但玛雅立场坚定。小溪开始恢复,她的良心也得到了安宁。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Her primary function was to assess water quality, but lately, she felt a rage building inside her."

**分析:** 这句话使用了对比连词 "but" 来连接两个并列分句,展现了职责与情感的冲突。"felt...building" 使用了感官动词加现在分词的结构,生动表现了情感的累积过程。

**亮点:** "rage building inside" 的意象非常有力,让读者感受到主人公内心的情感压力逐渐增强。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "A dark streak ran through the water like a scar."

**分析:** 这是一个精彩的明喻句。将污染的条纹比作"伤疤",不仅描述了视觉效果,还暗示了对自然的伤害。动词 "ran through" 给静态的污染赋予了动态感。

**亮点:** 简短有力的比喻句让环境问题更具触动力,这是优秀描写的典范。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Yet every time she thought of staying silent, she remembered the human cost."

**分析:** 使用了 "every time" 引导的时间状语从句,展现了反复的心理斗争。"human cost" 是一个抽象但有力的概念,将环境问题与人的福祉直接联系。

**亮点:** 这种重复性的心理活动描写增强了人物的真实感和道德困境的严重性。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "The creek began to heal, and so did her conscience."

**分析:** 这是一个并列句,使用了 "so did" 的倒装结构表示"也是如此"。将自然的恢复与人的内心平静并列,形成优美的对称。

**亮点:** 结尾的对称结构给人以完整感和希望感,是很好的收尾技巧。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 感官动词 + 宾语 + 现在分词

**原句:** "She felt a rage building inside her."

**聚焦:** feel + 宾语 + doing 结构

**用法说明:**
这个结构用来描述感知到某事正在进行。"feel + 名词 + doing" 强调动作的持续性和进行过程,比简单的 "felt rage" 更生动。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: She
- 谓语: felt
- 宾语: a rage
- 宾语补足语: building inside her

**可替换句:** "She felt rage growing within her." 或 "She was aware of rage building up inside."

---

### 聚焦点 2: 倒装结构 "so did"

**原句:** "The creek began to heal, and so did her conscience."

**聚焦:** "so + 助动词 + 主语" 倒装结构

**用法说明:**
当要表达"某人/某物也是如此"时,英语使用 "so + 助动词 + 主语" 的倒装结构。这里 "so did her conscience" 表示"她的良心也开始恢复",与前半句形成对照和呼应。

**时态匹配:**
- 前句用过去时 "began",所以用助动词 "did"
- 如果是现在时: "heals" → "so does her conscience"
- 如果是现在完成时: "has healed" → "so has her conscience"

**可替换句:** "The creek began to heal, and her conscience did too." (不倒装,较口语化)
