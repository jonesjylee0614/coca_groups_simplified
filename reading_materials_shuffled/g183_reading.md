**#Adventure** – A race against time for justice

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Sarah had worked **enough** /ɪˈnʌf/ (adv. 足够地) years at the **European** /ˌjʊrəˈpiːən/ (adj. 欧洲的) **headquarters** /ˈhedkwɔːrtərz/ (n. 总部) to know when something felt wrong. The **promotion** /prəˈmoʊʃn/ (n. 晋升) she'd been promised had gone to someone else—a **dozen** /ˈdʌzn/ (n. 一打；十二个) times now, it seemed. Messages sent **via** /ˈvaɪə/ (prep. 通过；经由) email went unanswered. Her **chest** /tʃest/ (n. 胸部) tightened with each rejection, but she refused to **assume** /əˈsuːm/ (v. 假设) defeat.

At an **international** /ˌɪntərˈnæʃnəl/ (adj. 国际的) conference, Sarah noticed a **crowd** /kraʊd/ (n. 人群) gathering around the **TV** /ˌtiː ˈviː/ (n. 电视) in the hotel lobby. News reports showed protests about corporate corruption. An **Iranian** /ɪˈreɪniən/ (adj. 伊朗的) journalist was speaking about workers' rights. Sarah felt a connection—this wasn't just about her **promotion** /prəˈmoʊʃn/ (n. 晋升); it was about a pattern of discrimination that put everyone **in** /ɪn/ (prep. 在...中) **danger** /ˈdeɪndʒər/ (n. 危险).

Back at her office, Sarah began her **search** /sɜːrtʃ/ (n./v. 搜索). She pulled old files from a **disk** /dɪsk/ (n. 磁盘) and opened **file** /faɪl/ (n. 文件) after **file** /faɪl/ (n. 文件). The data revealed systematic bias. She needed to **update** /ˈʌpdeɪt/ (v. 更新) her evidence and present it properly. But to whom? The **ministry** /ˈmɪnɪstri/ (n. 部门；内阁) of labor might listen, or perhaps a legal **partnership** /ˈpɑːrtnərʃɪp/ (n. 合作关系) could help.

Her colleague James offered support. "You're **worthy** /ˈwɜːrði/ (adj. 值得的；有价值的) of justice," he said. "But be careful. They might **whip** /wɪp/ (v. 鞭打；猛然移动) up false accusations or try to **rip** /rɪp/ (v. 撕裂) apart your reputation." Sarah understood the risk. This wasn't just about career **awareness** /əˈwernəs/ (n. 意识；认识); it was about refusing to accept a **compromise** /ˈkɑːmprəmaɪz/ (n./v. 妥协) that betrayed her values.

The day arrived when Sarah presented her findings to the board. She felt like a boxer about to throw a **punch** /pʌntʃ/ (n./v. 拳击；猛击), ready to fight for what was right. The **crowd** /kraʊd/ (n. 人群) of executives listened, some **in** /ɪn/ (prep. 在...中) shock, others **in** /ɪn/ (prep. 在...中) denial. The **European** /ˌjʊrəˈpiːən/ (adj. 欧洲的) director stood up. "We need to **search** /sɜːrtʃ/ (v. 审视) our practices," she admitted. "Thank you for your **awareness** /əˈwernəs/ (n. 意识) and courage."

Three months later, Sarah received not just her **promotion** /prəˈmoʊʃn/ (n. 晋升), but an **international** /ˌɪntərˈnæʃnəl/ (adj. 国际的) award for corporate justice. The changes she'd pushed for were being implemented **via** /ˈvaɪə/ (prep. 通过) new policies across all **headquarters** /ˈhedkwɔːrtərz/ (n. 总部). She had proven that speaking up was **worthy** /ˈwɜːrði/ (adj. 值得的) of the **danger** /ˈdeɪndʒər/ (n. 危险), and that **enough** /ɪˈnʌf/ (adj. 足够的) courage could change systems.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

莎拉在欧洲总部工作了足够多的年头,知道什么时候事情不对劲。她被承诺的晋升给了别人——现在看来已经有十几次了。通过电子邮件发送的消息得不到回复。每次被拒绝,她的胸口都会收紧,但她拒绝假设自己会失败。

在一次国际会议上,莎拉注意到酒店大堂里有一群人聚集在电视周围。新闻报道显示了关于企业腐败的抗议活动。一位伊朗记者正在谈论工人权利。莎拉感到一种联系——这不仅仅是关于她的晋升;这是一种让每个人都处于危险中的歧视模式。

回到办公室后,莎拉开始了她的搜索。她从磁盘中调出旧文件,一个文件接一个文件地打开。数据显示了系统性的偏见。她需要更新证据并妥善呈现。但向谁呈现?劳工部可能会听,或者法律合作伙伴可能会帮忙。

她的同事詹姆斯表示支持。"你值得获得公正,"他说。"但要小心。他们可能会煽动虚假指控,或试图撕裂你的声誉。"莎拉理解这个风险。这不仅仅是关于职业意识;这是关于拒绝接受背叛她价值观的妥协。

莎拉向董事会展示调查结果的那天到来了。她感觉自己像一个即将出拳的拳击手,准备为正确的事情而战。一群高管在听,有些人震惊,有些人否认。欧洲区总监站了起来。"我们需要审视我们的做法,"她承认。"感谢你的意识和勇气。"

三个月后,莎拉不仅获得了晋升,还获得了企业正义国际奖。她推动的改革正在通过新政策在所有总部实施。她证明了大声说出来值得冒危险,足够的勇气可以改变体制。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Sarah had worked enough years at the European headquarters to know when something felt wrong."

**分析:** "enough + 名词 + to do"结构表示"足够的...以至于能..."。"to know"是不定式作结果状语。这个句子用工作年限建立人物的经验和直觉,为后续情节发展做铺垫。

**亮点:** 开篇就建立主人公的专业性和敏锐度,让读者信任她的判断。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "The promotion she'd been promised had gone to someone else—a dozen times now, it seemed."

**分析:** 定语从句"she'd been promised"修饰"promotion",使用过去完成时的被动语态,强调承诺在先。破折号后"a dozen times"是夸张修辞,强调频繁程度,"it seemed"表达主观感受,增加真实感。

**亮点:** 通过夸张和主观感受的结合,让读者体会到主人公的沮丧和不公。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "This wasn't just about her promotion; it was about a pattern of discrimination that put everyone in danger."

**分析:** 使用分号连接两个相关但对比的句子。"not just...it was about..."结构将个人问题升华为系统问题。定语从句"that put everyone in danger"强调问题的严重性和普遍性。

**亮点:** 通过对比结构,将个人遭遇上升到社会正义层面,提升故事深度。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "She felt like a boxer about to throw a punch, ready to fight for what was right."

**分析:** 使用明喻"like a boxer",将抽象的勇气具象化为拳击手的形象。"about to throw a punch"是现在分词短语作定语,修饰"boxer"。逗号后"ready to fight"是形容词短语,进一步强化战斗姿态。

**亮点:** 生动的比喻让读者直观感受到主人公的决心和力量。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "enough + 名词 + to do"结构

**原句:** "Sarah had worked enough years at the European headquarters to know when something felt wrong."

**聚焦:** enough的位置和用法

**用法说明:** 
"enough"修饰名词时放在名词前面(enough years),表示"足够的..."。后接不定式"to do"表示结果或目的。这个结构强调数量或程度达到了某个标准,以至于能够做某事。

**结构对比:**
- enough + 名词: enough time, enough money
- 形容词/副词 + enough: old enough, quickly enough (enough放在形容词/副词后面)

**可替换句:** "Sarah had worked at the European headquarters for so many years that she could tell when something felt wrong." (使用"so...that"结构,但不如原句简洁)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 分号的使用

**原句:** "This wasn't just about her promotion; it was about a pattern of discrimination that put everyone in danger."

**聚焦:** 分号连接相关独立句

**用法说明:**
分号(;)用于连接两个关系密切但语法独立的句子,通常表示对比、因果或递进关系。比句号的分隔感弱,比逗号的连接更正式。在这个句子中,分号前后形成"否定-肯定"的对比结构,强调问题的本质。

**使用场景:**
1. 连接无连词的相关独立句
2. 含有逗号的复杂并列成分之间
3. 过渡词(however, therefore等)前

**可替换句:** 
- "This wasn't just about her promotion. It was about a pattern of discrimination..." (用句号,但削弱了连贯性)
- "This wasn't just about her promotion, but about a pattern..." (用连词,但改变了强调重点)
