## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

**There** /ðer/ (adv. 那里) in the corner of the library sat Maya, staring at her computer screen. She worked for an **association** /əˌsoʊsiˈeɪʃn/ (n. 协会;联想) that helped fight **racism** /ˈreɪsɪzəm/ (n. 种族主义). Their **facility** /fəˈsɪləti/ (n. 设施;能力) was small, but they had **access** /ˈækses/ (n. 进入权) to the **internet** /ˈɪntərnet/ (n. 互联网), which made their reach endless.

Maya had just received a **case** /keɪs/ (n. 案例;情况) that troubled her. A young **African** /ˈæfrɪkən/ (adj. 非洲的) student had been denied entry to a school with a **superior** /suːˈpɪriər/ (adj. 优越的;上级的) reputation. The school claimed it was a simple error, but the student's mother believed it was **racism** /ˈreɪsɪzəm/. She wanted to **look** /lʊk/ (v. 看;寻找) into the **real** /riːl/ (adj. 真实的) reason.

"At **least** /liːst/ (adv. 至少) let me **proceed** /prəˈsiːd/ (v. 继续进行)," Maya had told her boss that morning. "I have a **quest** /kwest/ (n. 探索;追求) for truth." Her boss nodded. "But be careful. The school has money and power. They might see you as the **devil** /ˈdevl/ (n. 魔鬼) trying to ruin their image."

Maya wasn't **worried** /ˈwɜːrid/ (adj. 担心的). She had faced **resistance** /rɪˈzɪstəns/ (n. 抵抗;反抗) before. This **era** /ˈɪrə/ (n. 时代;年代) was different from her parents' time—now everything was **online** /ˈɑːnlaɪn/ (adj. 在线的). Information could spread like **fire** /faɪər/ (n. 火;热情). But the **wall** /wɔːl/ (n. 墙) between truth and lies was still **tall** /tɔːl/ (adj. 高的).

She began her investigation. The school had an **elementary** /ˌelɪˈmentri/ (adj. 基础的;初级的) **mind** /maɪnd/ (n. 思想;头脑) when it came to diversity—they talked about it but didn't practice it. Maya found patterns in their admissions. Students with **African** /ˈæfrɪkən/ names were **expected** /ɪkˈspektɪd/ (v. 预期;期待) to have twice the qualifications.

"This is **aggressive** /əˈɡresɪv/ (adj. 侵略的;好斗的) discrimination," Maya said to herself. She knew her **quest** /kwest/ would be hard. The school might even **fire** /faɪər/ (v. 解雇;开火) back with lawyers. But staying silent wasn't an option.

She organized a meeting with the **association** /əˌsoʊsiˈeɪʃn/ members. "**There** /ðer/ are patterns we can't ignore," she showed them data. "The **resistance** /rɪˈzɪstəns/ to change is real, but so is our duty." One member asked, "What's the **adventure** /ədˈventʃər/ (n. 冒险) here? Why take this risk?"

Maya looked at him. "Because every child deserves a fair **case** /keɪs/. This isn't just about one student. It's about the **whole** /hoʊl/ (adj. 整个的) system." She explained how the current **era** /ˈɪrə/ demanded action, not just words. "If we **look** /lʊk/ away now, we're as bad as them."

The **association** /əˌsoʊsiˈeɪʃn/ decided to **proceed** /prəˈsiːd/. They published their findings **online** /ˈɑːnlaɪn/. The response was immediate. Parents, teachers, and students shared the article. The school tried to build a **wall** /wɔːl/ of denial, but truth had a way of breaking through.

Weeks later, the school agreed to change its policies. They would review every **case** /keɪs/ fairly. The young student was admitted. Maya received a thank-you call from the mother. "You gave my daughter **access** /ˈækses/ to her dreams," the woman said, her voice full of emotion.

Maya sat back in her chair. She looked at the **tall** /tɔːl/ **wall** /wɔːl/ outside her window—a physical **wall** /wɔːl/, but also a symbol. Walls could be climbed. **Racism** /ˈreɪsɪzəm/ could be fought. And in this **era** /ˈɪrə/, with the **internet** /ˈɪntərnet/ as a tool and **mind** /maɪnd/ as a weapon, change was possible. She felt no need to be **worried** /ˈwɜːrid/ anymore. The **real** /riːl/ **adventure** /ədˈventʃər/ was just beginning.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

在图书馆的角落里,玛雅坐在那里,盯着她的电脑屏幕。她为一个帮助对抗种族主义的协会工作。他们的设施很小,但他们可以接入互联网,这使他们的影响力无限。

玛雅刚刚收到一个令她不安的案例。一名年轻的非洲学生被拒绝进入一所声誉卓越的学校。学校声称这只是一个简单的错误,但学生的母亲认为这是种族主义。她想调查真正的原因。

"至少让我继续进行,"玛雅那天早上对她的老板说。"我有追求真相的使命。"她的老板点了点头。"但要小心。学校有钱有势。他们可能会把你看作试图毁掉他们形象的魔鬼。"

玛雅不担心。她以前面对过抵抗。这个时代与她父母的时代不同——现在一切都在线上。信息可以像火一样传播。但真相与谎言之间的墙仍然很高。

她开始了调查。学校在多样性方面有一个基础的思维——他们谈论它但不实践它。玛雅在他们的录取中发现了模式。有非洲名字的学生被期待拥有两倍的资格。

"这是侵略性的歧视,"玛雅自言自语。她知道她的探索会很艰难。学校甚至可能用律师反击。但保持沉默不是一个选择。

她组织了一次与协会成员的会议。"有我们不能忽视的模式,"她向他们展示数据。"对变革的抵抗是真实的,但我们的责任也是如此。"一位成员问:"这里的冒险是什么?为什么要冒这个险?"

玛雅看着他。"因为每个孩子都应该得到公平的对待。这不仅仅关于一个学生。这关乎整个系统。"她解释说,当前时代要求行动,而不仅仅是言语。"如果我们现在把目光移开,我们就和他们一样坏。"

协会决定继续进行。他们在网上发布了他们的调查结果。反应立即出现。家长、教师和学生分享了这篇文章。学校试图建立一堵否认之墙,但真相有办法突破。

几周后,学校同意改变其政策。他们将公平审查每个案例。那个年轻学生被录取了。玛雅接到母亲的感谢电话。"你给了我女儿实现梦想的机会,"那位女士说,声音充满感情。

玛雅坐回椅子上。她看着窗外高高的墙——一堵实体墙,但也是一个象征。墙可以被攀爬。种族主义可以被对抗。在这个时代,以互联网为工具,以思想为武器,改变是可能的。她不再需要担心了。真正的冒险才刚刚开始。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "She worked for an association that helped fight racism."

**分析:** 定语从句 "that helped fight racism" 修饰 association,说明协会的性质和目的。动词 "fight" 在这里是不及物动词,表示"斗争,对抗"。

**亮点:** 通过定语从句简洁地介绍了人物的工作背景和价值取向。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Information could spread like fire."

**分析:** 这是一个明喻句,使用 "like" 将信息的传播比作火的蔓延。情态动词 "could" 表示可能性。这个比喻生动地展现了互联网时代信息传播的速度和广度。

**亮点:** 用简单而有力的比喻,说明了互联网作为工具的特点。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "At least let me proceed."

**分析:** "At least" 意为"至少",用于提出最低要求或让步。这是一个祈使句,通过 "let me" 表达请求的语气,比直接的命令式更委婉。

**亮点:** 通过 "at least" 的使用,展现了说话人的坚持和策略——即使不能做所有事,也要做最基本的。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Walls could be climbed. Racism could be fought."

**分析:** 两个简短的被动语态句子并列,形成排比。使用被动语态强调行为的可能性,而非行为者。情态动词 "could" 表达信心和可能性。

**亮点:** 简洁有力的排比句式,既是对具体问题的总结,也是对普遍真理的宣示,富有感染力。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: At least 的用法

**原句:** "At least let me proceed."

**聚焦:** At least 表示最低限度

**用法说明:**
"At least" 意为"至少,最少",用于:
1. 表示最低数量或程度
2. 在让步或妥协时提出最基本要求
3. 从积极角度看待不理想的情况

在请求或建议的语境中,"at least" 降低了要求的门槛,使请求更容易被接受,同时也暗示说话人愿意妥协但坚持底线。

**用法示例:**
- 数量: At least ten people came. (至少十个人来了)
- 让步: At least try it. (至少试试看)
- 积极视角: At least it didn't rain. (至少没下雨)

**可替换句:** "Let me proceed, if nothing else." (如果别的都不行,让我继续进行。)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 明喻的使用

**原句:** "Information could spread like fire."

**聚焦:** Like 引导明喻

**用法说明:**
明喻(Simile)使用 "like" 或 "as" 将两个不同的事物进行比较,使描述更加生动形象。明喻不同于暗喻(metaphor),明喻明确使用比较词。这个修辞手法常用于:
1. 使抽象概念具象化
2. 增强表达的生动性
3. 帮助读者理解新概念

**明喻 vs 暗喻:**
- 明喻: Information spread like fire. (信息像火一样传播)
- 暗喻: Information was fire. (信息就是火)

**可替换句:** "Information could spread as quickly as fire." (使用 as...as 结构的明喻)
