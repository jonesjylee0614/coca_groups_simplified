**#TechAndFuture** – A story of science and discovery

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **sunset** /ˈsʌnset/ (n. 日落) painted the laboratory windows gold. Dr. Lin sat at his desk, reviewing the **precise** /prɪˈsaɪs/ (adj. 精确的) data from today's **experiment** /ɪkˈsperɪmənt/ (n. 实验). He had spent months trying to **obtain** /əbˈteɪn/ (v. 获得) funding for this research, and now the results were **definitely** /ˈdefɪnətli/ (adv. 肯定地；明确地) promising. His team was working on **technology** /tekˈnɑːlədʒi/ (n. 技术) that could clean water using nothing but **electricity** /ɪˌlekˈtrɪsəti/ (n. 电；电力).

"**Ooh** /uː/ (interj. 哦), look at this!" his colleague exclaimed, pointing to a screen. The **percentage** /pərˈsentɪdʒ/ (n. 百分比) of contaminants had dropped significantly. Dr. Lin felt excitement **mount** /maʊnt/ (v. 增长；攀登；n. 山). This was **because** /bɪˈkɔːz/ (conj. 因为) they had changed the **language** /ˈlæŋɡwɪdʒ/ (n. 语言；术语) of their chemical formula. Every word in science has **reason** /ˈriːzn/ (n. 理由；原因).

The research had been a **celebration** /ˌselɪˈbreɪʃn/ (n. 庆祝) of persistence. There was no **mandate** /ˈmændeɪt/ (n. 授权；命令) from the government to fund this, but Dr. Lin believed in his mission. He kept a small **cage** /keɪdʒ/ (n. 笼子) with a plant on his desk—a reminder that even trapped things can grow. Some called his dedication **musical** /ˈmjuːzɪkl/ (adj. 音乐的；悦耳的), a perfect harmony of work and purpose.

"What's the **probability** /ˌprɑːbəˈbɪləti/ (n. 可能性；概率) we'll succeed?" a young **man** /mæn/ (n. 男人) on the team asked. Dr. Lin smiled. "If we **exercise** /ˈeksərsaɪz/ (v. 锻炼；运用；n. 练习) patience and keep testing, I'd **bet** /bet/ (v. 打赌；n. 赌注) we'll get there." He had made a **list** /lɪst/ (n. 列表；v. 列举) of variables to test, and they were only halfway through.

In the corner of the lab sat an old **bottle** /ˈbɑːtl/ (n. 瓶子) filled with dirty water samples. Each **row** /roʊ/ (n. 排；列) of bottles represented a different location. Dr. Lin wanted to **entitle** /ɪnˈtaɪtl/ (v. 给...权利；给...题名) his paper "Clean **Instance** /ˈɪnstəns/ (n. 实例；情况): A New Method," but his colleague suggested something simpler.

During their break, they discussed who would **vote** /voʊt/ (v. 投票；n. 选票) to present at the next conference. Dr. Lin had to **weed** /wiːd/ (v. 除草；清除；n. 杂草) through countless submissions before. This time felt different—more **precise** /prɪˈsaɪs/ (adj. 精确的), more **musical** /ˈmjuːzɪkl/ (adj. 音乐的；悦耳的).

As the **sunset** /ˈsʌnset/ (n. 日落) deepened, Dr. Lin looked at his reflection in a glass **bottle** /ˈbɑːtl/ (n. 瓶子). "We're doing this **because** /bɪˈkɔːz/ (conj. 因为) it matters," he whispered. Science, he realized, was not just about equations—it was about **celebration** /ˌselɪˈbreɍʃn/ (n. 庆祝) of human curiosity.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

日落将实验室的窗户染成金色。林博士坐在桌前，审查今天实验的精确数据。他花了几个月试图获得这项研究的资金，现在结果肯定很有希望。他的团队正在研究只用电就能净化水的技术。

"哦，看这个！"他的同事惊呼，指着屏幕。污染物的百分比大幅下降。林博士感到兴奋不断增长。这是因为他们改变了化学公式的术语。科学中的每个词都有其原因。

这项研究是对坚持不懈的庆祝。政府没有授权资助这个项目，但林博士相信他的使命。他在桌上放了一个小笼子，里面有一株植物——提醒他即使被困的东西也能生长。有人称他的奉献精神如音乐般悦耳，是工作与目标的完美和谐。

"我们成功的可能性有多大？"团队中一位年轻男士问。林博士微笑了。"如果我们运用耐心并继续测试，我敢打赌我们会成功的。"他列了一个要测试的变量列表，他们才完成了一半。

实验室的角落里放着一个装满脏水样本的旧瓶子。每一排瓶子代表一个不同的地点。林博士想给他的论文题名为"清洁实例：一种新方法"，但他的同事建议用更简单的标题。

休息时，他们讨论谁会投票在下次会议上发言。林博士以前必须清除无数的投稿。这次感觉不同——更精确，更和谐。

随着日落加深，林博士看着自己在玻璃瓶中的倒影。"我们这样做是因为它很重要，"他低声说。他意识到，科学不仅仅是关于方程式——它是对人类好奇心的庆祝。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "He had spent months trying to obtain funding for this research, and now the results were definitely promising."

**分析:** 过去完成时"had spent"表示在"now"之前的持续动作。"trying to obtain"是动名词短语作宾语补足语。"definitely"强调确定性。

**亮点:** 时态对比（过去完成时 vs 一般过去时）展现了时间线和努力与回报的关系。

### 句子 2
**原句:** "This was because they had changed the language of their chemical formula."

**分析:** "This was because..."是解释原因的经典结构。"the language of"是比喻用法，将科学术语比作语言。

**亮点:** 使用比喻让抽象的科学概念更容易理解。

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Some called his dedication musical, a perfect harmony of work and purpose."

**分析:** "call + 宾语 + 形容词"结构。同位语"a perfect harmony..."进一步解释"musical"的含义，使用了比喻修辞。

**亮点:** 将"dedication"比作"musical"，创造了诗意的表达。

### 句子 4
**原句:** "If we exercise patience and keep testing, I'd bet we'll succeed."

**分析:** 条件句（第一类）："If + 现在时，主句用将来时"。"I'd bet"（I would bet）表示说话者的信心。

**亮点:** 用"exercise patience"（运用耐心）而非简单的"be patient"，显示了更高级的词汇运用。

### 句子 5
**原句:** "Science, he realized, was not just about equations—it was about celebration of human curiosity."

**分析:** 插入语"he realized"增加叙事层次。"not just about... but about..."结构强调对比。破折号强化重点。

**亮点:** 哲理性升华，将科学从技术层面提升到人文层面。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦（Grammar Focus）

### 焦点 1: 过去完成时表示"更早的过去"

**原句:** "He had spent months trying to obtain funding for this research, and now the results were definitely promising."

**聚焦:** 过去完成时 (had + past participle) 与一般过去时的对比

**用法:** 过去完成时表示在过去某个时间点之前完成的动作。这里"had spent"发生在"were promising"之前，建立了清晰的前后关系。

**可替换句:** "After spending months trying to obtain funding, he now saw promising results."

**区别:** 替换句用"after"明确表示时间顺序，但不如原句通过时态自然地表达时间层次。

### 焦点 2: 条件句中的情态动词

**原句:** "If we exercise patience and keep testing, I'd bet we'll succeed."

**聚焦:** 条件句中"would"的使用

**用法:** "I'd bet"（I would bet）在这里不是表示过去将来，而是表示说话者的推测和信心程度，比"I bet"更委婉。

**可替换句:** "If we exercise patience and keep testing, I'm sure we'll succeed."

**区别:** "I'm sure"更直接，"I'd bet"更口语化且带有轻松的语气。

**提示词:** obtain, experiment, precise, definitely, reason

### 6.4 讨论问题（Discussion）

> **"Should scientists focus only on projects with government funding and mandates, or should they pursue research based on personal conviction? What are the trade-offs?"**

Think about:
- How did Dr. Lin's personal belief drive his research despite lack of government mandate?
- What are the advantages and risks of self-directed scientific research?
- How does curiosity balance with practical funding needs in science?

**学习建议 (Study Tips):**

1. 注意过去完成时如何表达"更早的过去"，建立清晰的时间线
2. 学习使用比喻让抽象概念更生动（如"musical dedication"）
3. 掌握"not just about... but about..."结构来强调对比和升华
4. 观察科学词汇在日常语境中的使用：experiment, precise, data等

**词汇记忆技巧 (Memory Tips):**

- **obtain** 联想：ob-(向着) + tain(拿住) = 向着目标拿住 = 获得
- **precise** 联想：pre-(在前) + cise(切) = 预先切好的 = 精确的
- **probability** 联想：prob(证明) + ability = 能被证明的可能 = 概率
- **mandate** 联想：man(手) + date(给) = 授权交给 = 命令
