**#Adventure** – A story of courage and justice

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Every **Saturday** /ˈsætərdeɪ/ (n. 星期六), the courthouse in the border town would **run** /rʌn/ (v. 跑;运转;经营) sessions that determined the fate of people seeking asylum. Attorney Maria Santos had made it her life's work to represent those who had to **flee** /fliː/ (v. 逃跑;逃离) violence and persecution. The **trial** /ˈtraɪəl/ (n./adj. 审判;试验;试用的)s were never easy, but she approached each with a **firm** /fɜːrm/ (adj./n. 坚定的;公司) commitment to justice.

This **Saturday** was particularly challenging. Maria's client was Carlos, a **Mexican** /ˈmeksɪkən/ (adj./n. 墨西哥的;墨西哥人) journalist who had been forced to **flee** his country after exposing government corruption. "They **will** /wɪl/ (v./modal 将要;愿意;意志) kill me **if** /ɪf/ (conj. 如果) I go back," Carlos said during their **first** /fɜːrst/ (adj./adv. 第一的;首先) meeting. His hands trembled as he spoke.

Maria understood the gravity of the situation. She'd seen too many cases **where** /wer/ (adv./conj. 在哪里;在...的地方) people's lives hung in the balance. The immigration judge would need convincing evidence, and the prosecution—a **rep** /rep/ (n. 代表;代销商) from the government—would challenge every claim. This wasn't just about following procedures; it was about a human life.

The **trial** began **on** /ɑːn/ (prep. 在...上) time. Maria wore her professional **makeup** /ˈmeɪkʌp/ (n. 化妆品;组成), projecting confidence she didn't entirely feel. **Across** /əˈkrɔːs/ (prep./adv. 穿过;在对面) the room, the government **rep** looked prepared. The judge, an older man known for **firm** but fair rulings, called the session to order.

Carlos took the stand. Maria asked him to **relate** /rɪˈleɪt/ (v. 叙述;使有联系) his story. "I was a journalist," he began, his accent thick but his words clear. "In my country, telling the truth became a **crime** /kraɪm/ (n. 犯罪;罪行). They warned me to stop. When I didn't, they came for my family." His voice broke. "I had to **flee** to save my children."

The government **rep** stood **up** /ʌp/ (adv. 向上;起来). "Your Honor, the defendant has provided no concrete evidence. These claims could be fabricated. Our position is **firm**: without proof, this **act** /ækt/ (n./v. 行为;表演;扮演) of entering illegally cannot be excused." Maria felt anger rise but kept her composure.

"Permission to **appoint** /əˈpɔɪnt/ (v. 任命;指定) a witness," Maria requested. The judge nodded. Maria had arranged for a colleague from Mexico to testify via video. The connection was poor, the image occasionally freezing, but the testimony was powerful. The witness confirmed Carlos's journalism, the threats, the danger.

During a recess, Maria found Carlos outside, staring at the desert landscape. "What are you thinking?" she asked. "About my children," he replied. "About whether they **will** remember Mexico, or **if** this place **will** become home." Maria placed documents in her briefcase. "We're doing everything we can," she assured him. "Your **trial** isn't over yet."

The afternoon session brought unexpected challenges. The government **rep** presented evidence questioning the timeline of Carlos's departure. "He claims he left immediately after threats, but records show he remained two weeks. Was he **draft** /dræft/ (n./v. 草稿;征兵;草拟)ing his escape, or was there no real danger?" The implication was clear: Carlos might be lying.

Maria had anticipated this. "He stayed to **act** responsibly," she explained. "He needed to arrange safe passage for his family, gather documents, and prepare. **Voting** /ˈvoʊtɪŋ/ (n./adj. 投票;选举的) with your feet—choosing to **flee**—isn't impulsive. It's calculated survival." She produced evidence of the threats: photographs, messages, news articles about journalists being killed.

The judge studied the materials carefully. "And where is your family now?" he asked Carlos. "Safe," Carlos answered. "They couldn't come with me. The **usual** /ˈjuːʒuəl/ (adj. 通常的;平常的) routes were too dangerous. I came alone to establish asylum, then bring them legally." This answer seemed to resonate with the judge.

As testimony continued, Maria called an expert on press freedom who could **handle** /ˈhændl/ (v. 处理;操纵) complex questions about journalism in authoritarian contexts. The expert explained how Carlos's **act**ions were consistent with someone facing genuine persecution. "People don't **flee** comfort and stability lightly," the expert testified. "The decision to leave everything **behind** /bɪˈhaɪnd/ (prep./adv. 在...后面) is usually born of desperation."

The government **rep** tried to **relate** Carlos's case to others deemed fraudulent, but Maria countered each comparison. "Every case must be judged on its own merits," she argued. "To **appoint** a pattern where none exists is unjust. My client's **crime** was doing his job—speaking truth. His punishment should not be exile without protection."

As evening approached, both sides delivered closing arguments. The **rep** maintained a **firm** stance: laws must be enforced uniformly. Maria appealed to the judge's humanity: "Your Honor, the law exists to protect the vulnerable. Carlos **will** face death **if** deported. That's not speculation—it's documented reality. To send him back would make us complicit in whatever **crime** befalls him."

The courtroom fell silent. The judge removed his glasses, thinking. "This **trial** has presented compelling evidence on both sides," he said finally. "However, the standard is not comfort or preference—it's whether the applicant faces persecution. Based on what I've seen, I find that Mr. Carlos Santos does face credible threats." He paused, then continued: "Asylum is granted."

Maria felt relief flood through her. Carlos collapsed in his chair, tears streaming down his face. The government **rep** gathered papers, expression neutral, already thinking about the next case. For him, this was **usual** work. For Carlos, it was life or death.

Outside the courthouse, Carlos embraced Maria. "How can I thank you?" he asked. "By continuing your journalism here," Maria replied. "By ensuring that the truth you risked everything for continues to be told. That's how you honor this **will** to survive."

That night, Maria sat in her office, exhausted. Her **makeup** had long since faded, her professional armor removed. She thought about the others still waiting for **trial**s, still hoping to **run** from danger toward safety. The work never ended. People would always need to **flee**, and she would always be there to **handle** their cases.

Looking at the map **on** her wall, she saw the vast distances people traveled, the borders they **cross**ed (**cross** from Group 106), the lives left **behind**. Each pin represented a client, a story, a **trial**. Some were approved, some denied. But every **act** of advocacy mattered, every **firm** stand against injustice counted.

She remembered her **first** asylum case, years ago. She'd been terrified of making mistakes, of not being good enough. Now, experience had taught her that perfection wasn't possible, but presence was. Showing **up**, preparing thoroughly, fighting **firm**ly—that was what she could **relate** to her clients as her promise.

As she prepared to leave, her phone buzzed. A text from Carlos: "My family just boarded their plane. Thanks to you, we **will** be together soon. You gave us our future back." Maria smiled, tears forming. This was why she **run** toward difficult cases instead of away from them. This was why every **Saturday** spent in court, every exhausting **trial**, every battle with another government **rep** was worth it.

The **Mexican** restaurant **across** the street was still open. Maria decided to stop there, to eat something warm and think about tomorrow's cases. The owner, also an immigrant, always gave her extra food. "For the warrior," he'd say, refusing payment. Tonight, she'd accept gratefully.

Walking **across** the dark street, Maria felt the cool **desert** /ˈdezərt/ (n. 沙漠) air **on** her skin. This border town, this **place** where two worlds met, was her chosen battlefield. Here, she would continue to **act**, to **appoint** herself as defender of those who had to **flee**, to **handle** each **trial** as **if** everything depended **on** it—because for her clients, everything did.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

每个星期六,边境小镇的法院都会举行决定寻求庇护者命运的庭审。律师玛丽亚·桑托斯把代理那些不得不逃离暴力和迫害的人作为她的毕生事业。审判从来都不容易,但她以坚定的正义承诺对待每一个案子。

这个星期六特别具有挑战性。玛丽亚的委托人是卡洛斯,一位墨西哥记者,在揭露政府腐败后被迫逃离他的国家。"如果我回去,他们会杀了我,"卡洛斯在他们第一次会面时说。他说话时双手颤抖。

玛丽亚理解情况的严重性。她见过太多人命悬一线的案子。移民法官需要令人信服的证据,而起诉方——政府的代表——会挑战每一项主张。这不仅仅是遵循程序;这关乎一条人命。

审判准时开始。玛丽亚化着职业妆容,展现出她并不完全感受到的信心。房间对面,政府代表看起来准备充分。法官,一位以坚定但公正裁决而闻名的老人,宣布会议开始。

卡洛斯站在证人席上。玛丽亚让他叙述他的故事。"我是一名记者,"他开始说,口音很重但话语清晰。"在我的国家,说真话成了犯罪。他们警告我停止。当我没有停止时,他们来抓我的家人。"他的声音哽咽了。"我不得不逃跑以拯救我的孩子。"

政府代表站了起来。"法官大人,被告没有提供具体证据。这些主张可能是编造的。我们的立场是坚定的:没有证据,这种非法入境行为不能被原谅。"玛丽亚感到愤怒上升但保持镇静。

"请求指定一名证人,"玛丽亚请求。法官点头。玛丽亚安排了一位来自墨西哥的同事通过视频作证。连接很差,图像偶尔会冻结,但证词很有力。证人证实了卡洛斯的新闻工作、威胁和危险。

休息期间,玛丽亚发现卡洛斯在外面,盯着沙漠景观。"你在想什么?"她问。"想我的孩子们,"他回答。"想他们是否会记得墨西哥,或者这个地方是否会成为家。"玛丽亚把文件放进公文包。"我们正在尽一切努力,"她向他保证。"你的审判还没有结束。"

下午的庭审带来了意外的挑战。政府代表提出了质疑卡洛斯离境时间线的证据。"他声称在受到威胁后立即离开,但记录显示他又待了两周。他是在草拟逃跑计划,还是根本没有真正的危险?"暗示很明显:卡洛斯可能在撒谎。

玛丽亚预料到了这一点。"他留下来是为了负责任地行事,"她解释说。"他需要为家人安排安全通道、收集文件并做准备。用脚投票——选择逃离——不是冲动的。这是精心计算的生存。"她出示了威胁的证据:照片、信息、关于记者被杀的新闻文章。

法官仔细研究了材料。"你的家人现在在哪里?"他问卡洛斯。"安全的地方,"卡洛斯回答。"他们不能和我一起来。通常的路线太危险了。我独自来建立庇护,然后合法地带他们过来。"这个答案似乎引起了法官的共鸣。

随着证词的继续,玛丽亚传唤了一位能够处理关于威权背景下新闻自由复杂问题的专家。专家解释了卡洛斯的行动如何与面临真正迫害的人一致。"人们不会轻易逃离舒适和稳定,"专家作证。"决定抛下一切通常源于绝望。"

政府代表试图将卡洛斯的案子与其他被认定为欺诈的案子联系起来,但玛丽亚反驳了每一个比较。"每个案子都必须根据其自身的优点来判断,"她争辩道。"在不存在的地方指定一个模式是不公正的。我委托人的罪行是做他的工作——说真话。他的惩罚不应该是没有保护的流亡。"

临近傍晚时,双方发表了结案陈词。代表保持坚定立场:法律必须统一执行。玛丽亚诉诸法官的人性:"法官大人,法律的存在是为了保护弱者。如果被驱逐,卡洛斯将面临死亡。这不是推测——这是有记录的现实。把他送回去会使我们成为任何降临在他身上的罪行的共犯。"

法庭陷入沉默。法官摘下眼镜,思考着。"这次审判双方都提出了令人信服的证据,"他最后说。"然而,标准不是舒适或偏好——而是申请人是否面临迫害。根据我所看到的,我认为卡洛斯·桑托斯先生确实面临可信的威胁。"他停顿了一下,然后继续说:"批准庇护。"

玛丽亚感到宽慰涌过全身。卡洛斯瘫倒在椅子上,泪流满面。政府代表收拾文件,表情中立,已经在想下一个案子了。对他来说,这是平常的工作。对卡洛斯来说,这是生死攸关。

在法院外,卡洛斯拥抱了玛丽亚。"我怎么感谢你?"他问。"继续在这里做你的新闻工作,"玛丽亚回答。"确保你冒一切风险的真相继续被讲述。这就是你尊重这种生存意志的方式。"

那天晚上,玛丽亚坐在办公室里,筋疲力尽。她的妆早已褪去,职业盔甲被卸下。她想到其他仍在等待审判、仍希望从危险跑向安全的人。工作永远不会结束。人们总会需要逃离,而她总会在那里处理他们的案子。

看着墙上的地图,她看到人们旅行的巨大距离、他们跨越的边界、留在身后的生活。每个图钉代表一个委托人、一个故事、一场审判。有些被批准,有些被拒绝。但每一次倡导行动都很重要,每一次对不公正的坚定立场都很重要。

她记得多年前她的第一个庇护案。她曾害怕犯错,害怕不够好。现在,经验告诉她完美是不可能的,但在场是可能的。出现、充分准备、坚定战斗——这就是她能向委托人叙述的承诺。

当她准备离开时,手机震动了。卡洛斯发来短信:"我的家人刚刚登机。多亏了你,我们很快就会团聚。你给了我们未来。"玛丽亚微笑着,眼泪涌出。这就是为什么她奔向困难的案子而不是远离它们。这就是为什么每个星期六在法院度过、每一场令人筋疲力尽的审判、与另一位政府代表的每一场战斗都是值得的。

街对面的墨西哥餐厅还开着。玛丽亚决定停下来,吃点温暖的东西,想想明天的案子。老板,也是一名移民,总是给她额外的食物。"给战士的,"他会说,拒绝收钱。今晚,她会感激地接受。

穿过黑暗的街道,玛丽亚感到凉爽的沙漠空气在皮肤上。这个边境小镇,这个两个世界相遇的地方,是她选择的战场。在这里,她将继续行动,指定自己为那些不得不逃离的人的捍卫者,处理每一场审判,就好像一切都取决于它——因为对她的委托人来说,一切确实如此。
