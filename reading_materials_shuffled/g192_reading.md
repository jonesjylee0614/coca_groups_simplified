**#MoralReflection** – A story of dignity and truth

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **mirror** /ˈmɪrər/ (n. 镜子) on the wall reflected Maria's tired face. It was **February** /ˈfebrueri/ (n. 二月), and she had been working as a **specialist** /ˈspeʃəlɪst/ (n. 专家) in civil rights for three years. Today, she would **help** /help/ (v. 帮助) defend a **civilian** /səˈvɪliən/ (n. 平民；adj. 民用的) against **discrimination** /dɪˌskrɪmɪˈneɪʃn/ (n. 歧视). The case file sat on her desk, and she needed to **emphasize** /ˈemfəsaɪz/ (v. 强调) key facts during the hearing.

Her assistant knocked and entered. "The **profile** /ˈproʊfaɪl/ (n. 简介；侧面) of the witness is ready," he said, handing her a folder. Maria nodded. The witness was **unfortunate** /ʌnˈfɔːrtʃənət/ (adj. 不幸的), having lost his job **until** /ənˈtɪl/ (prep./conj. 直到) someone spoke up. The company's defense was, frankly, **bullshit** /ˈbʊlʃɪt/ (n. 胡说；废话), but Maria knew she had to stay professional.

"What **sort** /sɔːrt/ (n. 种类；v. 分类) of questions will they ask?" her client asked nervously when they met. His hands were **bare** /ber/ (adj. 赤裸的；空的), fidgeting with a pen. Maria looked at him with **encouraging** /ɪnˈkɜːrɪdʒɪŋ/ (adj. 令人鼓舞的) eyes. "Don't worry. Just be honest. That's the most **helpful** /ˈhelpfəl/ (adj. 有帮助的) thing you can do."

The courtroom was filled with **people** /ˈpiːpl/ (n. 人们). The opposing lawyer tried to **phrase** /freɪz/ (v. 措辞；n. 短语) his questions to confuse the witness. "Your story keeps changing, doesn't it?" he asked sharply. Maria stood. "**Off** /ɔːf/ (adv./prep. 离开；关闭) the record, this is harassment," she said firmly. The judge agreed and warned the lawyer.

The case dragged on for a **period** /ˈpɪriəd/ (n. 时期；句号) of four hours. Maria had to **retrieve** /rɪˈtriːv/ (v. 取回；恢复) documents twice from her bag. **Depending** /dɪˈpendɪŋ/ (prep. 取决于) on the jury's decision, her client could win or lose everything. The **political** /pəˈlɪtɪkl/ (adj. 政治的) climate made such cases harder these days.

During the break, Maria saw her client staring at his wedding ring. "I want to **marry** /ˈmæri/ (v. 结婚) my partner without fear," he said quietly. "This job was supposed to **help** us build a **fence** /fens/ (n. 栅栏；v. 围住) around our **vs** /ˈvɜːrsəs/ (prep. 对；与...相对)... I mean, to protect our future." Maria understood. The fight wasn't just about one job—it was about dignity.

When the verdict came, the jury ruled in their favor. Maria's client cried. "Thank you for **help** /help/ (v. 帮助)-ing me," he said. Maria smiled. Truth had won today, and that was deeply **encouraging** /ɪnˈkɜːrɪdʒɪŋ/ (adj. 令人鼓舞的).

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

墙上的镜子映出了玛丽亚疲惫的脸。现在是二月，她担任民权专家已经三年了。今天，她将帮助一位平民对抗歧视。案件档案放在她的桌上，她需要在听证会上强调关键事实。

她的助手敲门进来。"证人的简介准备好了，"他递给她一个文件夹说。玛丽亚点点头。这位证人很不幸，在有人站出来说话之前，他已经失去了工作。公司的辩护坦白说就是胡说八道，但玛丽亚知道她必须保持专业。

"他们会问什么样的问题？"她的客户见面时紧张地问。他赤裸的双手摆弄着一支笔。玛丽亚用鼓励的眼神看着他。"别担心。只要诚实。这是你能做的最有帮助的事。"

法庭里挤满了人。对方律师试图措辞让证人困惑。"你的故事一直在变，不是吗？"他尖锐地问。玛丽亚站起来。"这是骚扰，"她坚定地说。法官同意并警告了那位律师。

案件拖了四个小时。玛丽亚不得不两次从包里取回文件。取决于陪审团的决定，她的客户可能赢得或失去一切。如今的政治气候使这类案件变得更加困难。

休息期间，玛丽亚看到她的客户盯着他的结婚戒指。"我想和我的伴侣结婚而不用恐惧，"他平静地说。"这份工作本应帮助我们建立一个栅栏...我是说，保护我们的未来。"玛丽亚理解。这场斗争不仅仅是关于一份工作——而是关于尊严。

当判决出来时，陪审团做出了有利于他们的裁决。玛丽亚的客户哭了。"谢谢你帮助我，"他说。玛丽亚微笑了。今天真理获胜了，这令人深受鼓舞。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The company's defense was, frankly, bullshit, but Maria knew she had to stay professional."

**分析:** 这个句子使用了插入语"frankly"（坦白说），增加了口语化的真实感。转折连词"but"连接了两个对比的想法：个人观点 vs 职业要求。

**亮点:** 插入语的使用让叙述更有个性，同时展示了角色的内心冲突。

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Just be honest. That's the most helpful thing you can do."

**分析:** 两个简短的句子形成了建议的节奏。第二句中"that"指代前面整个建议，"the most + 形容词 + thing"是表达最高级建议的常用结构。

**亮点:** 简洁有力，适合用于给出建议或强调重点。

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Depending on the jury's decision, her client could win or lose everything."

**分析:** "Depending on"引导条件状语，放在句首强调了不确定性。"could"表示可能性，"win or lose everything"形成对比，强调赌注之大。

**亮点:** 展示如何用分词短语开头增加句式变化。

### 句子 4
**原句:** "The fight wasn't just about one job—it was about dignity."

**分析:** 使用"not just... but..."结构的变体，通过破折号强调真正的重点。"about"重复使用形成了对比的平行结构。

**亮点:** 破折号的使用增强了戏剧性和情感冲击力。

### 句子 5
**原句:** "Truth had won today, and that was deeply encouraging."

**分析:** 过去完成时"had won"强调结果的完成，"that"指代整个前句的事实。副词"deeply"强化了形容词"encouraging"的程度。

**亮点:** 抽象概念"truth"作主语，赋予了哲理性和升华感。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦（Grammar Focus）

### 焦点 1: 插入语的使用

**原句:** "The company's defense was, frankly, bullshit, but Maria knew she had to stay professional."

**聚焦:** 插入语 (frankly) 的位置和作用

**用法:** 插入语用逗号隔开，可以放在句中表达说话者的态度或补充信息。常见的插入语包括：honestly, actually, in my opinion, to be fair等。

**可替换句:** "Frankly speaking, the company's defense was bullshit, but Maria had to stay professional."

**区别:** 将插入语移到句首，语气稍微正式一些，但不如原句自然流畅。

### 焦点 2: 反身结构强化主题

**原句:** "The fight wasn't just about one job—it was about dignity."

**聚焦:** "not just... but..."的变体用法

**用法:** 这个结构用于强调真正的重点，否定表面现象，揭示深层含义。破折号增强了停顿和强调效果。

**可替换句:** "The fight was about more than one job; it was about dignity."

**区别:** 使用分号的版本更文学化，但不如破折号版本有冲击力。
