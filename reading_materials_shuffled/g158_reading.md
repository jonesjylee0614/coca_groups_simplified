**#MoralReflection** – A story of judgment, growth, and finding balance

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Every **morning** /ˈmɔːrnɪŋ/ (n. 早晨;上午), David sat at his desk with his **PC** /ˌpiːˈsiː/ (n. 个人电脑) and reviewed **cases** /ˈkeɪsɪz/ (n. 案件;情况[case的复数]) for the court. As a **judge** /dʒʌdʒ/ (n./v. 法官;判断), he had the power to change lives with his decisions. But lately, he had been **questioning** /ˈkwestʃənɪŋ/ (v. 质疑;提问[question的现在分词]) everything. Did his judgments truly **satisfy** /ˈsætɪsfaɪ/ (v. 满足;使满意) justice? Or were they shaped by his own **weaknesses** /ˈwiːknəsɪz/ (n. 弱点;缺点[weakness的复数])?

The **case** that troubled him most involved a young woman accused of theft. She had stolen food from a store—just a few items, **tiny** /ˈtaɪni/ (adj. 极小的;微小的) in value. The store owner wanted her prosecuted. "I **declare** /dɪˈkler/ (v. 宣布;声明)," he had said in court, "that this sets a bad **example**. If we don't punish theft, crime will increase."

David had read the **case** **notes** /noʊts/ (n. 笔记;注释[note的复数]) carefully. The woman was a single mother who had lost her job. She had no **adequate** /ˈædɪkwət/ (adj. 足够的;适当的) food for her children. In a moment of desperation, she had taken what she needed. Now she faced serious charges, possibly even time in a detention facility—what some people bluntly called "the **pit** /pɪt/ (n. 坑;深渊;核)."

As David sat in his office that **October** /ɑːkˈtoʊbər/ (n. 十月) **morning**, drinking **beer** /bɪr/ (n. 啤酒)—well, actually it was coffee, but he wished it were **beer** given the stress—he thought about his own life. He came from a comfortable background. He had never known real hunger. How could he **judge** someone whose desperation he had never experienced?

He thought about a **paragraph** /ˈpærəɡræf/ (n. 段落) he had read in a philosophy book: "We **judge** others by their actions, but we **judge** ourselves by our intentions." Was he being fair? Could he **justify** /ˈdʒʌstɪfaɪ/ (v. 证明...正当;为...辩护) sending this woman to prison when her intention was simply to feed her children?

David also considered his own **weaknesses**. He prided himself on being logical and fair, but he knew he had biases. Everyone did. His **weakness** was that he sometimes judged **cases** too harshly, trying to appear tough. **Supporters** /səˈpɔːrtərz/ (n. 支持者;拥护者[supporter的复数]) of strict law enforcement praised him for this, but was it really justice?

That afternoon, David received unexpected **information** /ˌɪnfərˈmeɪʃn/ (n. 信息;资料). An **operation** /ˌɑːpəˈreɪʃn/ (n. 手术;行动;操作) by social services had investigated the woman's situation. They confirmed she had been living in terrible conditions. Her children were hungry. She had applied for help but was told she wasn't eligible because of a **tiny** technical **error** in her paperwork. The system had failed her **before** she stole anything.

David felt his chest tighten. This changed everything. The woman wasn't a criminal taking advantage of society. She was a victim of bureaucratic **junk** /dʒʌŋk/ (n. 垃圾;废物;无价值的东西)—meaningless rules that prevented people from getting the help they needed. How could he **satisfy** the demands of justice in a situation like this?

He thought about another troubled **case** from his past. Years ago, he had sentenced a man to prison for a similar crime. Later, David learned the man had committed suicide in prison, unable to cope with being separated from his family. That memory haunted David. It was his **weakness** as a **judge**—he had focused on the law but forgotten the human being.

Now, facing this new **case**, David knew he had to be different. He called the prosecutor. "I've reviewed this **case** thoroughly," he said. "I don't think prison is the **adequate** response here. This woman needs help, not punishment."

The prosecutor disagreed. "With respect, your honor, if you don't send a strong message, others will think they can steal without consequences. We need to **inform** /ɪnˈfɔːrm/ (v. 通知;告知) the public that theft has consequences."

David understood the argument. But he also knew that **graphic** /ˈɡræfɪk/ (adj. 生动的;图解的) displays of harsh punishment didn't actually reduce crime. What reduced crime was addressing its **root** causes—poverty, lack of opportunity, inadequate social **support**. Studies showed this clearly, though some **supporters** of tough-on-crime policies chose to ignore the evidence.

That evening, David went **skiing** /ˈskiːɪŋ/ (n./v. 滑雪[ski的现在分词])—well, not actually. He went to a local park instead, to think. As he walked, he thought about his role. A **judge** wasn't just someone who applied rules mechanically. A **judge** had to consider context, to exercise wisdom, to **satisfy** not just the letter of the law but its **spirit**.

He thought about **cases** of **rape** /reɪp/ (n./v. 强奸) he had presided over—situations where the law was clear and punishment was absolutely necessary. Those **cases** were different. They involved intentional harm, violation of another person. But this **case** of a mother stealing food? The harm was **tiny** compared to the harm that would come from tearing her family apart.

David made his decision. In court the next day, he spoke directly to the woman. "I've reviewed your **case**," he said. "I've read every **note**, every **paragraph** of testimony. I understand you made a choice that broke the law. But I also understand why you made that choice."

He paused, looking at the packed courtroom. "Some people here today are **supporters** of strict punishment. They believe I should send you to prison to send a message. But I don't believe that message would **satisfy** justice. Instead, I'm going to **grant** /ɡrænt/ (v. 授予;给予;承认) you probation with conditions. You'll work with social services to get the support you need. You'll attend programs to help you find employment. And you'll do community service."

The courtroom erupted in mixed reactions. Some people applauded. Others shook their heads in disapproval. The store owner looked angry. But David knew he had made the right decision. He had judged not just the action, but the person and the circumstances. He had acknowledged his own **weakness**—his tendency to be too harsh—and corrected it.

After the hearing, a young lawyer approached David. "Your honor, some people will **question** your decision. They'll say you were too soft, that you let a criminal go free."

David nodded. "I know. But I can **satisfy** my conscience. I judged this **case** based on all the **information** available, not just on a **tiny** fraction of the story. That's what a **judge** should do."

Weeks later, David learned that the woman had found a job. She was working hard, paying back the store through community service, and her children were enrolled in a program that ensured they had **adequate** meals. The outcome **satisfied** everyone—even the store owner eventually admitted that this result was better than sending the woman to prison.

David reflected on the **case**. He realized that being a **judge** meant constantly examining your own **weaknesses**, your biases, your assumptions. It meant being willing to **question** not just the people who came before you, but yourself. Every **morning** when he sat down at his **PC** to review **cases**, he now asked himself: Am I judging fairly? Am I considering all the **information**? Am I letting my own **weaknesses** cloud my judgment?

He thought about the philosophy book again, the one with that powerful **paragraph**. He added his own thought: "A good **judge** doesn't just **declare** what the law says. A good **judge** asks what justice requires, and has the courage to **justify** decisions with wisdom rather than just rules."

The **October** days grew shorter, and David continued his work. Each **case** was different. Some were clear-cut, requiring firm punishment. Others, like the mother's **case**, required mercy and understanding. The key was to **judge** each situation on its own **merits**, not to apply **one** rigid standard to every situation.

David's journey taught him that judging others was one of the hardest responsibilities anyone could have. It required not just knowledge of the law, but knowledge of yourself—your **strengths** and your **weaknesses**. It required the humility to **question** your own assumptions and the courage to **satisfy** justice even when others disagreed.

As he locked his office that evening, David felt a sense of peace. He would continue to face difficult **cases**. He would continue to be **questioned** by **supporters** and critics alike. But he knew that as long as he judged with both wisdom and compassion, as long as he remained aware of his own **weaknesses**, he could **satisfy** his calling. And in the end, that was all any **judge**—or any person—could hope to do.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

每天早晨,大卫坐在桌前用他的个人电脑审查法庭案件。作为一名法官,他有权通过决定改变生命。但最近,他一直在质疑一切。他的判决真的满足正义吗?还是被他自己的弱点所塑造?

最困扰他的案件涉及一名被控盗窃的年轻女士。她从商店偷了食物——只是几样东西,价值微小。店主想要起诉她。"我宣布,"他在法庭上说,"这树立了一个坏榜样。如果我们不惩罚盗窃,犯罪会增加。"

大卫仔细阅读了案件笔记。这位女士是一位失去工作的单身母亲。她没有足够的食物给孩子们。在绝望的时刻,她拿走了她需要的东西。现在她面临严重指控,甚至可能在拘留设施服刑——有些人直言不讳地称之为"深坑"。

当大卫那个十月的早晨坐在办公室里喝啤酒时——好吧,实际上是咖啡,但考虑到压力,他希望是啤酒——他想到了自己的生活。他来自富裕的背景。他从未经历过真正的饥饿。他怎么能判断一个他从未经历过绝望的人呢?

他想起在哲学书中读到的一段话:"我们根据行为判断他人,但根据意图判断自己。"他公平吗?当她的意图只是喂养孩子时,他能证明把这位女士送进监狱是正当的吗?

大卫也考虑了自己的弱点。他以逻辑和公平自豪,但他知道他有偏见。每个人都有。他的弱点是有时对案件判断过于严厉,试图显得强硬。严格执法的支持者为此称赞他,但这真的是正义吗?

那天下午,大卫收到了意外信息。社会服务部门的一次行动调查了这位女士的情况。他们确认她一直生活在可怕的条件下。她的孩子们很饿。她申请了帮助,但被告知由于文件中的一个微小技术错误而不符合资格。在她偷任何东西之前,系统就已经辜负了她。

大卫感到胸口发紧。这改变了一切。这位女士不是利用社会的罪犯。她是官僚垃圾的受害者——无意义的规则阻止人们获得所需的帮助。在这样的情况下,他如何能满足正义的要求?

他想起了过去另一个困扰他的案件。多年前,他因类似罪行判一个人入狱。后来,大卫得知那个人在监狱里自杀了,无法承受与家人分离。那段记忆困扰着大卫。这是他作为法官的弱点——他关注法律但忘记了人。

现在,面对这个新案件,大卫知道他必须不同。他打电话给检察官。"我彻底审查了这个案件,"他说。"我不认为监狱是这里的适当回应。这位女士需要帮助,而不是惩罚。"

检察官不同意。"恕我直言,法官大人,如果你不发出强烈的信息,其他人会认为他们可以不受后果地偷窃。我们需要告知公众盗窃有后果。"

大卫理解这个论点。但他也知道严厉惩罚的生动展示实际上并不能减少犯罪。减少犯罪的是解决其根本原因——贫困、缺乏机会、支持不足。研究清楚地表明了这一点,尽管一些强硬犯罪政策的支持者选择忽视证据。

那天晚上,大卫去滑雪——好吧,实际上不是。他去了当地的公园,思考。当他走路时,他想到了他的角色。法官不只是机械地应用规则的人。法官必须考虑背景,运用智慧,不仅满足法律的文字而且满足其精神。

他想起他主持过的强奸案件——法律明确且绝对需要惩罚的情况。那些案件是不同的。它们涉及故意伤害,侵犯他人。但这个母亲偷食物的案件?伤害与拆散她家庭所带来的伤害相比是微小的。

大卫做出了决定。第二天在法庭上,他直接对那位女士说话。"我审查了你的案件,"他说。"我读了每一条笔记,每一段证词。我理解你做出了违反法律的选择。但我也理解你为什么做出那个选择。"

他停顿了一下,看着挤满的法庭。"今天这里的一些人是严格惩罚的支持者。他们认为我应该把你送进监狱来发送信息。但我不相信那个信息会满足正义。相反,我将给予你附条件的缓刑。你将与社会服务部门合作以获得所需的支持。你将参加帮助你找到工作的项目。你将做社区服务。"

法庭爆发出褒贬不一的反应。一些人鼓掌。其他人摇头表示不赞成。店主看起来很生气。但大卫知道他做出了正确的决定。他判断的不仅是行为,还有人和环境。他承认了自己的弱点——他过于严厉的倾向——并纠正了它。

听证会后,一位年轻律师走近大卫。"法官大人,有些人会质疑你的决定。他们会说你太软了,你让一个罪犯逍遥法外。"

大卫点点头。"我知道。但我可以满足我的良心。我根据所有可用信息判断这个案件,而不仅仅是故事的一小部分。这就是法官应该做的。"

几周后,大卫得知那位女士找到了工作。她努力工作,通过社区服务偿还商店,她的孩子们参加了一个确保他们有足够餐食的项目。结果让每个人都满意——甚至店主最终承认这个结果比把那位女士送进监狱更好。

大卫反思这个案件。他意识到作为一名法官意味着不断检查自己的弱点、偏见、假设。它意味着愿意质疑的不仅是出现在你面前的人,还有你自己。每天早晨当他坐下来用他的电脑审查案件时,他现在问自己:我判断公平吗?我考虑了所有信息吗?我让自己的弱点蒙蔽了我的判断吗?

他又想起了那本哲学书,有那个强有力段落的那本。他加上了自己的想法:"一个好法官不只是宣布法律说什么。一个好法官问正义需要什么,并有勇气用智慧而不只是规则来证明决定的正当性。"

十月的日子变短了,大卫继续他的工作。每个案件都不同。有些是明确的,需要坚定的惩罚。其他的,像母亲的案件,需要仁慈和理解。关键是根据每种情况本身的优点来判断,而不是对每种情况应用一个僵化的标准。

大卫的旅程教会他,判断他人是任何人都能承担的最艰难的责任之一。它不仅需要法律知识,还需要对自己的了解——你的优点和弱点。它需要质疑自己假设的谦逊和满足正义的勇气,即使其他人不同意。

当他那天晚上锁上办公室时,大卫感到一种平静。他将继续面对困难的案件。他将继续被支持者和批评者质疑。但他知道,只要他以智慧和同情心判断,只要他保持对自己弱点的意识,他就能满足他的使命。最终,这就是任何法官——或任何人——能希望做到的一切。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 动名词作主语

**原句:** "Judging others was one of the hardest responsibilities anyone could have."

**聚焦:** 动名词 "Judging" 作主语

**用法说明:** 
动名词(动词 -ing 形式)可以作主语,表示抽象的行为或概念。这种用法让句子更正式、更概括。动名词作主语时,谓语动词用单数形式。

**结构:**
- 动名词(短语)+ 动词单数 + ...
- Judging others + was + ...

**类似例子:**
- Learning English takes time.
- Swimming is good exercise.
- Reading books broadens your mind.

**可替换句:** "To judge others was one of the hardest responsibilities..." (不定式作主语,较少用但也正确)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 情态动词 could 表示能力或可能性

**原句:** "How could he judge someone whose desperation he had never experienced?"

**聚焦:** could 在疑问句中表示能力或可能性

**用法说明:**
"Could" 在这里表示"能够"的疑问,质疑做某事的能力或资格。在疑问句中,"could" 常用来表达怀疑或反问,语气比 "can" 更委婉或更强调困难。

**could 的主要用法:**
1. can 的过去式: He could swim when he was five.
2. 委婉请求: Could you help me?
3. 表示可能性: It could rain tomorrow.
4. 表示能力(带怀疑): How could anyone do that?

**可替换句:** "How can he judge..." (用现在时,语气更直接)
