**#MoralReflection** – A story of truth and legacy

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Sarah was a **photographer** /fəˈtɑːɡrəfər/ (n. 摄影师) who traveled to a small **island** /ˈaɪlənd/ (n. 岛屿) near the **bay** /beɪ/ (n. 海湾). The **historical** /hɪˈstɔːrɪkl/ (adj. 历史的；有历史意义的) village there was disappearing. **Agriculture** /ˈæɡrɪkʌltʃər/ (n. 农业) had failed, and young people were leaving. She wanted to make a **contribution** /ˌkɑːntrɪˈbjuːʃn/ (n. 贡献；捐献) by saving their story in photographs.

The **ride** /raɪd/ (n./v. 乘坐；骑行) to the island was rough. The boat moved through **heavy** /ˈhevi/ (adj. 沉重的；猛烈的) waves. Sarah felt **nervous** /ˈnɜːrvəs/ (adj. 紧张的；不安的). Her **heart** /hɑːrt/ (n. 心脏；心) beat fast. This project was a **risk** /rɪsk/ (n./v. 风险；冒险). Would the villagers trust her? Would her work matter?

When she arrived, the village leader met her. His face showed sadness. "Yesterday, we had a **funeral** /ˈfjuːnərəl/ (n. 葬礼)," he said. "Our oldest farmer died. He knew every **set** /set/ (n. 一套；集合) of traditions, every old song." Sarah's **heart** **squeezed** /skwiːz/ (v. 挤压；紧握) with pain. She was too late to photograph him.

"Can I **assist** /əˈsɪst/ (v. 帮助；协助) in some way?" Sarah asked. The leader nodded. "**Turn** /tɜːrn/ (v. 转动；变成) your camera toward what remains. Show the world our **belief** /bɪˈliːf/ (n. 信念；信仰) in the land and sea."

Sarah worked for three weeks. She photographed fishermen, fields, and ceremonies. **Additionally** /əˈdɪʃənəli/ (adv. 此外；另外), she recorded their voices—their hopes, their fears. One man told her about a **criminal** /ˈkrɪmɪnl/ (n./adj. 罪犯；犯罪的) who once stole their fishing nets but later returned them with tears. "Even the bad can **turn** good," he said.

An **attorney** /əˈtɜːrni/ (n. 律师) from the mainland visited. He talked about land rights and **copyright** /ˈkɑːpiraɪt/ (n./v. 版权；获得版权) law. "Fifty **percent** /pərˈsent/ (n. 百分比；百分之...) of this island legally belongs to a company," he explained. The news was like a **heavy** stone on Sarah's **heart**. The company's **vice** /vaɪs/ (n. 邪恶；恶习；副的) president wanted to build hotels.

Sarah realized her photographs were not just art—they were evidence. They belonged to the **realm** /relm/ (n. 领域；王国) of history and justice. But the idea felt **abstract** /ˈæbstrækt/ (adj. 抽象的；理论上的) until she saw the children playing near the **bay**. Their laughter was real. Their future was at **risk**.

She decided to share her photos with news organizations. She gave up her **copyright** to make sure the images spread widely. It was her **contribution** to the village—not just beautiful pictures, but a call for help.

Three months later, the company withdrew its plans. The **historical** village was **set** to become a protected area. Sarah attended a celebration on the island. "You **assisted** us when we needed it most," the leader said.

Sarah smiled. Her **belief** in photography's power had been proven. It was not about fame. It was about using your gifts to protect what matters.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

莎拉是一名摄影师，她前往海湾附近的一个小岛。那里的历史村庄正在消失。农业失败了，年轻人纷纷离开。她想通过照片保存他们的故事，以此做出贡献。

前往岛上的航程很艰难。船在猛烈的海浪中行驶。莎拉感到紧张。她的心跳得很快。这个项目是一个冒险。村民们会信任她吗？她的工作会有意义吗？

当她到达时，村长接待了她。他的脸上露出悲伤。"昨天，我们举行了一场葬礼，"他说。"我们最年长的农民去世了。他知道每一套传统，每一首老歌。"莎拉的心痛苦地紧缩。她来得太晚了，无法拍摄他。

"我能以某种方式帮忙吗？"莎拉问。村长点点头。"把你的相机转向留下的东西。向世界展示我们对土地和海洋的信念。"

莎拉工作了三周。她拍摄了渔民、田野和仪式。此外，她还记录了他们的声音——他们的希望、他们的恐惧。一个男人告诉她关于一个罪犯的故事，他曾偷走了他们的渔网，但后来流着泪归还了。"即使是坏人也能变好，"他说。

一位来自大陆的律师来访。他谈论土地权和版权法。"这个岛屿的百分之五十在法律上属于一家公司，"他解释道。这个消息就像一块沉重的石头压在莎拉心上。公司副总裁想建酒店。

莎拉意识到她的照片不仅仅是艺术——它们是证据。它们属于历史和正义的领域。但这个想法感觉很抽象，直到她看到孩子们在海湾附近玩耍。他们的笑声是真实的。他们的未来处于危险之中。

她决定与新闻机构分享她的照片。她放弃了版权，以确保图像广泛传播。这是她对村庄的贡献——不仅仅是美丽的图片，而是呼吁帮助。

三个月后，公司撤回了计划。历史村庄将成为保护区。莎拉参加了岛上的庆祝活动。"你在我们最需要的时候帮助了我们，"村长说。

莎拉微笑了。她对摄影力量的信念得到了证明。这不是关于名声。而是关于用你的天赋去保护重要的东西。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "She wanted to make a contribution by saving their story in photographs."

**分析:** "make a contribution" 是固定搭配，意为"做出贡献"。介词 "by" 引导方式状语，说明通过何种方式做贡献。"by + 动名词"是英语中常用的表达方式的结构。

**亮点:** 使用 "by doing something" 可以简洁地说明达成目标的手段，比用从句更简洁有力。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Her heart squeezed with pain."

**分析:** 这是一个生动的隐喻表达。"squeeze" 本意是"挤压"，这里用来描述心理上的痛苦，就像心被挤压一样。这种具象化的描写让情感更有画面感。

**亮点:** 英语文学中常用身体感觉来表达情感，如 "heart sank"（心沉了）、"stomach turned"（胃翻了）等。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Additionally, she recorded their voices—their hopes, their fears."

**分析:** "Additionally" 作为过渡词，引出补充信息。破折号后的内容对 "their voices" 进行具体解释。这种结构让句子层次清晰，信息丰富。

**亮点:** 破折号的使用使得句子节奏有变化，同时突出了破折号后的内容。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "It was not about fame. It was about using your gifts to protect what matters."

**分析:** 这是典型的对比强调句式："It's not about A. It's about B." 通过否定和肯定的对比，清晰地表达了主题。"what matters" 是名词性从句，作介词 to 的宾语。

**亮点:** 这种结构在结尾使用，能够升华主题，给读者留下深刻印象。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: By + 动名词表示方式

**原句:** "She wanted to make a contribution by saving their story in photographs."

**聚焦:** By + doing 结构表示方式或手段

**用法说明:**
"By + 动名词" 是英语中表达"通过...方式"的常用结构，回答 "How?" 这个问题。

**常见例句:**
- He improved his English by reading books. (通过读书提高英语)
- You can lose weight by exercising regularly. (通过规律运动减肥)
- She earned money by teaching online. (通过在线教学赚钱)

**注意区别:**
- By doing: 表示方式（通过做某事）
- For doing: 表示原因或目的（因为做某事）
- In doing: 表示在做某事的过程中

**可替换句:** "She wanted to make a contribution through saving their story in photographs."

---

### 聚焦点 2: 抽象名词的具象化使用

**原句:** "The news was like a heavy stone on Sarah's heart."

**聚焦:** 用具体物象表达抽象情感（隐喻）

**用法说明:**
英语文学中常用具体可感的事物来表达抽象的情感或概念。这种修辞手法叫做隐喻（metaphor）。

**常见模式:**
- 情感如重物：The guilt weighed on him. / A burden on her shoulders.
- 情感如温度：A warm welcome. / A cold response.
- 情感如运动：Her spirits lifted. / His hopes sank.

**写作建议:**
使用隐喻时要确保比喻自然、贴切，不要过度使用以免显得做作。

**可替换句:** "The news made Sarah feel terrible." (直白表达，但缺乏画面感)
