**#MoralReflection** – A story of justice and compassion

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **airport** /ˈerpɔːrt/ (n. 机场) was crowded as Father Michael waited at gate **sixth** /sɪksθ/ (num. 第六). He was flying to testify in a **tragic** /ˈtrædʒɪk/ (adj. 悲剧的；悲惨的) case involving a refugee family. His **Catholic** /ˈkæθəlɪk/ (adj. 天主教的；n. 天主教徒) parish had been helping them for months, but now they faced deportation. The **jurisdiction** /ˌdʒʊrɪsˈdɪkʃn/ (n. 管辖权；司法权) of the case was complex, involving multiple states.

As he sat down, Father Michael reviewed his notes. The **discussion** /dɪˈskʌʃn/ (n. 讨论；论述) with the lawyers had been intense. They needed him to **help** /help/ (v. 帮助；n. 帮助) establish the family's character and integration into the **community** /kəˈmjuːnəti/ (n. 社区). **Even** /ˈiːvn/ (adv. 甚至；平坦地；adj. 平坦的) though he wasn't a legal expert, his testimony could **appeal** /əˈpiːl/ (v. 呼吁；上诉；n. 呼吁) to the judge's sense of mercy.

A woman sat down next to him, carrying a **copy** /ˈkɑːpi/ (n. 复制品；副本；v. 复制) of a legal journal. "Are you Father Michael?" she asked. He nodded, surprised. "I'm Elena, the family's lawyer. Thank you for coming. Your **availability** /əˌveɪləˈbɪləti/ (n. 可用性；空闲) means everything to us."

They began talking about the case. The father of the family had been accused of not **comply** /kəmˈplaɪ/ (v. 遵守；顺从)-ing with certain paperwork requirements. **But** /bʌt/ (conj. 但是) Elena argued it was an honest mistake, not intentional defiance. "**Many** /ˈmeni/ (adj./pron. 许多) people don't understand how **unusual** /ʌnˈjuːʒuəl/ (adj. 不寻常的；罕见的) and complicated immigration rules can be," she explained.

Father Michael agreed. "In my church, they've been model **community** /kəˈmjuːnəti/ (n. 社区) members. The father works at a **plant** /plænt/ (n. 工厂；植物；v. 种植), supporting his family. The mother volunteers at the local **health** /helθ/ (n. 健康；卫生) clinic." He paused. "To **punish** /ˈpʌnɪʃ/ (v. 惩罚；处罚) them with deportation seems extreme."

Elena pulled out a thick **pack** /pæk/ (n. 包；一群；v. 打包) of documents. "I've compiled testimonies from **many** /ˈmeni/ (adj./pron. 许多) **people** /ˈpiːpl/ (n. 人们；民族), including teachers and neighbors. The judge needs to see they're not statistics—they're humans with dignity." She looked at Father Michael. "**Personally** /ˈpɜːrsənəli/ (adv. 就个人而言；亲自), I believe this case will set a precedent."

The flight was called. As they boarded, Father Michael thought about the **stadium** /ˈsteɪdiəm/ (n. 体育场；运动场) where he'd once given a speech about compassion. He'd spoken about how faith wasn't about judgment but about lifting people up. Now he had a chance to **help** /help/ (v. 帮助) put those words into action.

On the plane, Elena showed him photos of the family at a **celebration** /ˌselɪˈbreɪʃn/ (n. 庆祝) for their youngest daughter's birthday. "Look at the joy," she whispered. "This is what we're fighting for—not just legal **jurisdiction** /ˌdʒʊrɪsˈdɪkʃn/ (n. 管辖权), but basic humanity."

Father Michael nodded. "I'll tell the truth about who they are. That's all I can do. The rest is up to **yours** /jʊrz/ (pron. 你的；你们的)... I mean, it's up to the judge." Elena smiled. "No, Father. It's up to all of us. Justice isn't **somebody** /ˈsʌmbədi/ (pron. 某人；重要人物) else's job—it's everyone's responsibility."

At the **top** /tɑːp/ (n. 顶部；adj. 最高的) of the courthouse steps the next day, Father Michael felt nervous. But when he saw the family waiting—faces full of **hope** /hoʊp/ (n. 希望；v. 希望)—his purpose became clear. He would speak with conviction, and he would not let their **tragic** /ˈtrædʒɪk/ (adj. 悲剧的) situation define them. They deserved better. They deserved a chance.

**Even** /ˈiːvn/ (adv. 甚至) if he couldn't guarantee the outcome, he could ensure their story was heard with dignity. As he walked into the courtroom, he remembered a **phrase** /freɪz/ (n. 短语；措辞；v. 措辞) from scripture: "Whatever you did for one of the least of these, you did for me." That was his **hook** /hʊk/ (n. 钩子；吸引人之处)—his way of framing the **discussion** /dɪˈskʌʃn/ (n. 讨论).

His testimony would **appeal** /əˈpiːl/ (v. 呼吁；上诉) not just to law, but to conscience. And perhaps, he thought, that was where true **fortune** /ˈfɔːrtʃən/ (n. 财富；运气) lay—in doing what was right, regardless of the result.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

机场很拥挤，迈克尔神父在第六号登机口等候。他要飞去为一个涉及难民家庭的悲剧案件作证。他的天主教教区已经帮助他们好几个月了，但现在他们面临驱逐出境。此案的管辖权很复杂，涉及多个州。

当他坐下时，迈克尔神父复习了笔记。与律师的讨论很激烈。他们需要他帮助确立这个家庭的品格和融入社区的情况。尽管他不是法律专家，但他的证词可以呼吁法官的怜悯之心。

一位女士坐在他旁边，拿着一本法律期刊的副本。"您是迈克尔神父吗？"她问。他点点头，有些惊讶。"我是埃琳娜，这个家庭的律师。谢谢您能来。您的空闲对我们来说意味着一切。"

他们开始讨论案件。这家的父亲被指控不遵守某些文书要求。但埃琳娜辩称这是一个诚实的错误，不是故意的反抗。"许多人不理解移民规则有多么不寻常和复杂，"她解释道。

迈克尔神父表示同意。"在我的教堂里，他们一直是模范社区成员。父亲在一家工厂工作，养活家人。母亲在当地卫生诊所做志愿者。"他停顿了一下。"用驱逐出境来惩罚他们似乎太过分了。"

埃琳娜拿出一大包文件。"我收集了许多人的证词，包括教师和邻居。法官需要看到他们不是统计数字——他们是有尊严的人。"她看着迈克尔神父。"就个人而言，我相信这个案件会开创先例。"

航班被叫到了。登机时，迈克尔神父想起了他曾在体育场发表关于同情心的演讲。他谈到信仰不是关于评判，而是关于提升人们。现在他有机会帮助将这些话付诸行动。

在飞机上，埃琳娜给他看了这家人为最小的女儿庆祝生日的照片。"看这份喜悦，"她低声说。"这就是我们为之奋斗的——不仅仅是法律管辖权，而是基本的人性。"

迈克尔神父点点头。"我会说出关于他们是谁的真相。这是我能做的。剩下的就看...我是说，这取决于法官了。"埃琳娜微笑了。"不，神父。这取决于我们所有人。正义不是某人的工作——这是每个人的责任。"

第二天在法院台阶顶部，迈克尔神父感到紧张。但当他看到等待的家人——脸上充满希望——他的目的变得清晰了。他会以信念说话，他不会让他们的悲剧处境定义他们。他们值得更好的。他们值得一个机会。

即使他不能保证结果，他也能确保他们的故事被有尊严地听到。当他走进法庭时，他记起了圣经中的一句话："你们为这些最小的弟兄中的一个所做的，就是为我做的。"那就是他的切入点——他构建讨论的方式。

他的证词不仅会呼吁法律，还会呼吁良心。也许，他想，真正的财富就在于此——做正确的事，不管结果如何。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Even though he wasn't a legal expert, his testimony could appeal to the judge's sense of mercy."

**分析:** "Even though"引导让步状语从句，比"although"语气更强。"appeal to"表示"呼吁；吸引"。"sense of mercy"用抽象名词表达复杂情感。

**亮点:** 让步从句有效地对比了神父的身份局限与他证词的潜在影响力。

### 句子 2
**原句:** "They've been model community members."

**分析:** 现在完成时"have been"表示从过去到现在的持续状态。"model"作形容词修饰"community members"，表示"模范的"。

**亮点:** 简洁有力的肯定句，用"model"一词概括了全面的正面评价。

### 句子 3
**原句:** "The judge needs to see they're not statistics—they're humans with dignity."

**分析:** 破折号用于强调对比和纠正。"not... but..."结构的变体。"with dignity"介词短语作定语修饰"humans"。

**亮点:** 通过"statistics vs humans"的对比，深刻表达了人性化诉求。

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Justice isn't somebody else's job—it's everyone's responsibility."

**分析:** 破折号连接两个对立的观点。"somebody else's"与"everyone's"形成鲜明对比。使用所有格形式使表达更简洁。

**亮点:** 哲理性表达，从个体责任升华到集体责任，富有感染力。

### 句子 5
**原句:** "Whatever you did for one of the least of these, you did for me."

**分析:** "Whatever"引导名词性从句作宾语。"the least of these"用最高级表示"最卑微的人"。平行结构"you did... you did..."增强节奏感。

**亮点:** 引用宗教文本，赋予叙述更深的道德维度和普世价值。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦（Grammar Focus）

### 焦点 1: "Even though" vs "Although"

**原句:** "Even though he wasn't a legal expert, his testimony could appeal to the judge's sense of mercy."

**聚焦:** "Even though" 的强调作用

**用法:** "Even though"比"although"语气更强，更强调转折的意外性或对比的强烈程度。适用于需要特别强调让步的情况。

**可替换句:** "Although he wasn't a legal expert, his testimony could appeal to the judge's sense of mercy."

**区别:** "Although"较中性，"even though"更强调"尽管...但竟然..."的意外性。

### 焦点 2: 破折号的强调和对比功能

**原句:** "The judge needs to see they're not statistics—they're humans with dignity."

**聚焦:** 破折号 (—) 用于强调和对比

**用法:** 破折号比逗号停顿更长，比句号又不完全分开，适合用于强调、解释或突出对比。在演讲式的书面语中特别有效。

**可替换句:** "The judge needs to see they're not statistics but humans with dignity."

**区别:** "but"连接较平淡，破折号版本更有戏剧性和情感冲击力。
