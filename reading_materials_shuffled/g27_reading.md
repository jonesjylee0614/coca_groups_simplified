**#LightHumor** – A story of unexpected connections

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **public** /ˈpʌblɪk/ (adj. 公共的) library was hosting a **joke** /dʒoʊk/ (n. 笑话) writing contest. Marcus, a **mechanic** /məˈkænɪk/ (n. 机修工), had entered **possibly** /ˈpɑːsəbli/ (adv. 可能) the strangest entry ever written. His **story** /ˈstɔːri/ (n. 故事) about a talking wrench had made the judges laugh, though some found it **extremely** /ɪkˈstriːmli/ (adv. 极其) odd. He **dressed** /drest/ (v. 穿衣) in his best clothes and arrived early, his **headache** /ˈhedeɪk/ (n. 头痛) from nerves making him **visit** /ˈvɪzɪt/ (v. 参观) the water fountain three times.

"You look nervous," said Emma, the **liberal** /ˈlɪbərəl/ (adj. 自由的) arts professor who organized the event. She was known for her ability to **edit** /ˈedɪt/ (v. 编辑) **valuable** /ˈvæljuəbl/ (adj. 有价值的) work without **dismissing** /dɪsˈmɪsɪŋ/ (v. 解雇) the writer's voice. "I need to **apologize** /əˈpɑːlədʒaɪz/ (v. 道歉) in advance," Marcus said. "My writing might **lack** /læk/ (v. 缺乏) **beauty** /ˈbjuːti/ (n. 美丽), but I hope it's funny."

Emma smiled and adjusted her **dress** /dres/ (n. 连衣裙). "Humor is a form of **beauty**. Don't **dismiss** /dɪsˈmɪs/ (v. 不予考虑) your own work. **Hence** /hens/ (adv. 因此) why we invited you." She led him to a small room where **protesters** /ˈproʊtestərz/ (n. 抗议者)—or rather, anxious writers—waited behind a **curtain** /ˈkɜːrtn/ (n. 窗帘). "Everyone here has been **productive** /prəˈdʌktɪv/ (adj. 多产的) in their own way. Some write **versions** /ˈvɜːrʒnz/ (n. 版本) of the same **joke** five times before they find the right one."

At the **podium**, Marcus told his **story**. It was about a mechanic who **spent** time teaching a wrench to tell jokes, only to discover the wrench was funnier than him. The audience laughed. One woman even **cried** tears of joy. Afterward, a young writer approached him. "I wanted to **pin** /pɪn/ (v. 钉住) my hopes on winning, but your **story** taught me to **behave** /bɪˈheɪv/ (v. 表现) differently. It's not about being perfect—it's about being honest."

Marcus left with second place and a small **salt** /sɔːlt/ (n. 盐) shaker shaped like a trophy—a **joke** prize from the judges. He didn't care. He had found his voice, and **possibly** a new hobby. As he walked home, he noticed the **spending** /ˈspendɪŋ/ (n. 花费) of time on writing had been worth it. The **headache** was gone, replaced by pride.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

公共图书馆正在举办一场笑话写作比赛。马库斯,一名机修工,提交了可能是有史以来最奇怪的作品。他关于一个会说话的扳手的故事让评委们笑了,尽管有些人觉得它极其古怪。他穿上最好的衣服,早早到达,紧张引起的头痛让他去饮水机那里三次。

"你看起来很紧张,"组织活动的自由艺术教授艾玛说。她以能够编辑有价值的作品而不抹杀作者声音的能力而闻名。"我需要提前道歉,"马库斯说。"我的写作可能缺乏美感,但我希望它有趣。"

艾玛微笑着调整她的连衣裙。"幽默是一种美的形式。不要不考虑你自己的作品。因此我们才邀请了你。"她把他带到一个小房间,那里的抗议者——或者说,焦虑的作家们——在窗帘后面等待。"这里的每个人都以自己的方式多产。有些人在找到正确的笑话之前会写同一个笑话的五个版本。"

在讲台上,马库斯讲了他的故事。这是关于一个机修工花时间教一把扳手讲笑话,结果发现扳手比他更有趣。观众笑了。一位女士甚至喜极而泣。之后,一位年轻作家走近他。"我想把希望寄托在获胜上,但你的故事教会了我要表现得不同。重要的不是完美——而是诚实。"

马库斯带着第二名和一个盐瓶形状的小奖杯离开了——这是评委们的玩笑奖品。他不在乎。他找到了自己的声音,可能还找到了一个新爱好。当他走回家时,他注意到花在写作上的时间是值得的。头痛消失了,取而代之的是自豪。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "My writing might lack beauty, but I hope it's funny."

**分析:** "might" 表示不确定的可能性,语气委婉。"lack + 名词" 表示"缺乏某物"。转折词 "but" 引出积极的一面,展现自我认知与希望并存。

**亮点:** 谦虚但不自卑的表达方式,适合自我介绍或推荐作品时使用。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Humor is a form of beauty. Don't dismiss your own work. Hence why we invited you."

**分析:** 三个短句组成,节奏明快。第一句是陈述观点,第二句是祈使句鼓励,第三句用 "hence" 给出原因。"Hence why..." 是口语化表达,相当于 "That's why..."。

**亮点:** 短句的使用增强说服力和鼓励效果,适合激励性对话。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "I wanted to pin my hopes on winning, but your story taught me to behave differently."

**分析:** "pin one's hopes on" 是固定搭配,表示"把希望寄托在..."。"teach sb to do" 表示"教某人做某事"。转折连词 "but" 引出思想的转变。

**亮点:** 真诚地表达从他人身上学到的东西,体现开放的学习态度。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "He noticed the spending of time on writing had been worth it."

**分析:** "notice + that从句(省略了that)" 表示"注意到..."。"the spending of time on..." 将动词 spend 名词化。"be worth it" 是常用短语,表示"值得"。

**亮点:** 将时间投资与价值回报联系起来,适合反思性叙述。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "lack" 作动词的用法

**原句:** "My writing might lack beauty, but I hope it's funny."

**聚焦:** 动词 lack 的用法

**用法说明:** 
"lack" 作动词时,是及物动词,后面直接接宾语,不需要介词。意为"缺乏、没有"。注意:不能说 "lack of something" 作动词用,只能说 "lack something"。"lack of" 只能用于名词短语。

**正确用法:**
- 动词: They lack experience. (他们缺乏经验)
- 名词短语: The lack of experience is a problem. (经验的缺乏是个问题)

**常见错误:**
- ❌ They lack of experience.
- ✅ They lack experience.
- ✅ There is a lack of experience.

**可替换表达:**
- My writing might not have beauty... (没有...)
- My writing might be short on beauty... (在...方面不足)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "hence" 的用法

**原句:** "Hence why we invited you."

**聚焦:** 连接副词 hence

**用法说明:**
"hence" 是正式用语,意为"因此、由此",用来表示因果关系。传统上,"hence" 后面不接 "why",但在现代口语中,"hence why" 已经被广泛接受,相当于 "that's why"。

**正式用法:**
- He's qualified; hence, we hired him. (他有资格,因此我们雇用了他)
- It's raining; hence the cancellation. (下雨了,因此取消了)

**口语用法:**
- Hence why we invited you. = That's why we invited you. (这就是为什么我们邀请你)

**类似连接词:**
- Therefore, ... (因此...)
- Thus, ... (因而...)
- Consequently, ... (结果...)
