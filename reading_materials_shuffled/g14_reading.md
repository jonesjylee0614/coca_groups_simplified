## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Dmitri was a **Russian** /ˈrʌʃn/ (adj. 俄罗斯的) immigrant who lived in the **northeast** /ˌnɔːrˈθiːst/ (n. 东北) part of town. He played **guitar** /ɡɪˈtɑːr/ (n. 吉他) on street corners, his music floating through the air. **Most** /moʊst/ (det. 大多数) people walked by without stopping, but some would pause, smile, and drop coins into his **cheap** /tʃiːp/ (adj. 便宜的) hat.

Life wasn't **easy** /ˈiːzi/ (adj. 容易的). Dmitri had no stable income, **neither** /ˈniːðər/ (det. 两者都不) a **great** /ɡreɪt/ (adj. 伟大的;极好的) apartment **nor** /nɔːr/ (conj. 也不) fancy belongings. But he had his music, and that was a **great** /ɡreɪt/ thing. He believed everyone deserved to hear beauty, and if he could **gain** /ɡeɪn/ (v. 获得) even one person's smile, his day had meaning.

One afternoon, a woman stopped to listen. She worked at the university's music **faculty** /ˈfækəlti/ (n. 全体教员;才能). "You have talent," she said. "Would you do me a **favor** /ˈfeɪvər/ (n. 帮助;恩惠) and perform at our **union** /ˈjuːniən/ (n. 联盟;工会) hall next week?" Dmitri was surprised. "Me? But I'm just a street musician."

"**Fashion** /ˈfæʃn/ (n. 时尚;方式) changes," she replied, "but real music is timeless. Your playing has **substance** /ˈsʌbstəns/ (n. 物质;实质)." She explained that students needed to see **similar** /ˈsɪmələr/ (adj. 相似的) passion, regardless of where it came from. "**Neither** /ˈniːðər/ wealth **nor** /nɔːr/ status defines an **actor** /ˈæktər/ (n. 演员) or artist. It's the heart that matters."

Dmitri thought about it. What the **hell** /hel/ (n. 地狱), he figured—why not try? He didn't **guess** /ɡes/ (v. 猜测) he'd have much to lose. Over the next week, he practiced harder than ever. He wanted to make the **most** /moʊst/ of this **opportunity** /ˌɑːpərˈtuːnəti/ (n. 机会).

The night of the performance arrived. Dmitri stood backstage, taking deep breaths. He needed **oxygen** /ˈɑːksɪdʒən/ (n. 氧气) to calm his nerves. When he walked out, the hall was full. Students, professors, even the **senior** /ˈsiːniər/ (adj. 年长的;高级的) dean were there. He sat down and began to play.

His fingers moved across the strings like water flowing. The music wasn't **funny** /ˈfʌni/ (adj. 有趣的), but it was deep and moving. He played a **Russian** /ˈrʌʃn/ folk song about finding **roots** /ruːts/ (n. 根;根源) in foreign soil. The **dynamics** /daɪˈnæmɪks/ (n. 动力学;动态) of his playing—soft then loud, slow then fast—held everyone's attention.

When he finished, silence filled the room. Then applause erupted. The **average** /ˈævərɪdʒ/ (adj. 平均的) street performance never received such a response. People stood, some with tears in their eyes. The woman from the **faculty** /ˈfækəlti/ smiled at him. "You see? You brought everyone together."

After the show, a **senior** /ˈsiːniər/ professor offered him a teaching position—not formal employment, but a chance to share his gift with students. "We can't pay much, just a **gram** /ɡræm/ (n. 克) of recognition and small **oil** /ɔɪl/ (n. 石油;油) money," she joked, "but you'd be helping young people find their voice."

Dmitri thought about his journey from the **northeast** /ˌnɔːrˈθiːst/ of Russia to here. He'd **gained** /ɡeɪnd/ so much more than he'd lost. "I don't need **great** /ɡreɪt/ wealth," he said. "Just the chance to make a difference. That's the **greatest** /ˈɡreɪtɪst/ gift." He accepted, knowing his music had found its home—not in a fancy concert hall, but in the hearts of people who needed it **most** /moʊst/.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

德米特里是一位俄罗斯移民,住在城镇的东北部。他在街角弹吉他,他的音乐飘荡在空中。大多数人走过时不会停下,但有些人会停下,微笑,并把硬币扔进他那顶便宜的帽子里。

生活并不容易。德米特里没有稳定的收入,既没有很好的公寓,也没有高档的物品。但他有他的音乐,这是一件很棒的事。他相信每个人都值得听到美,如果他能获得哪怕一个人的微笑,他的一天就有意义。

一天下午,一位女士停下来听。她在大学音乐学院工作。"你有天赋,"她说。"你能帮我一个忙,下周在我们的工会大厅演出吗?"德米特里很惊讶。"我?但我只是一个街头音乐家。"

"时尚会改变,"她回答,"但真正的音乐是永恒的。你的演奏有实质。"她解释说,学生需要看到相似的激情,无论它来自哪里。"财富和地位都不能定义一个演员或艺术家。重要的是心。"

德米特里想了想。管它呢,他想——为什么不试试?他猜想他没什么可失去的。在接下来的一周里,他比以往任何时候都更加努力地练习。他想充分利用这个机会。

演出之夜到来了。德米特里站在后台,深呼吸。他需要氧气来平复紧张的情绪。当他走出去时,大厅里人满为患。学生、教授,甚至高级院长都在那里。他坐下来开始演奏。

他的手指在琴弦上移动,像水一样流动。音乐不是有趣的,但它深刻而动人。他演奏了一首俄罗斯民歌,讲述在异国土地上寻找根源的故事。他演奏的动态——轻柔然后响亮,缓慢然后快速——吸引了所有人的注意力。

当他结束时,房间里一片寂静。然后掌声爆发了。一般的街头表演从未收到过这样的反应。人们站起来,有些人眼含泪水。学院的那位女士对他微笑。"你看?你把每个人都聚在一起了。"

演出后,一位资深教授向他提供了一个教学职位——不是正式雇用,但是一个与学生分享他天赋的机会。"我们付不了多少,只是一点点认可和小钱,"她开玩笑说,"但你会帮助年轻人找到自己的声音。"

德米特里想起了他从俄罗斯东北部到这里的旅程。他获得的比失去的多得多。"我不需要巨大的财富,"他说。"只要有机会产生影响。那是最伟大的礼物。"他接受了,知道他的音乐找到了它的家——不是在华丽的音乐厅里,而是在最需要它的人们心中。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Most people walked by without stopping, but some would pause, smile, and drop coins into his cheap hat."

**分析:** 这句使用对比结构,"most people" vs "some",展示了不同的反应。"Without stopping" 使用介词+动名词表示方式。三个并列动词 "pause, smile, and drop" 描绘了一系列连贯动作。

**亮点:** 通过对比和连续动作的描写,生动展现了街头艺人的日常经历。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Neither wealth nor status defines an actor or artist."

**分析:** 这是 "neither...nor..." 结构,表示"既不...也不..."。两个名词 "wealth" 和 "status" 并列作主语,动词用单数 "defines"。这是一个富有哲理的陈述句。

**亮点:** 使用否定并列结构,强有力地表达了艺术价值观,语言简洁而深刻。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "The dynamics of his playing—soft then loud, slow then fast—held everyone's attention."

**分析:** 破折号中的内容解释了 "dynamics" 的具体表现。两组对比词 "soft/loud" 和 "slow/fast" 用 "then" 连接,表示变化过程。主句使用简单过去时,动词 "held" 生动描绘了音乐的吸引力。

**亮点:** 通过对比词和破折号的使用,将抽象的音乐动态具象化,让读者"听"到音乐。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "He'd gained so much more than he'd lost."

**分析:** 这是一个比较句,"more than" 连接两个过去完成时的动词。Had gained 和 had lost 形成鲜明对比,总结了人物的成长。使用过去完成时强调了在故事结束前已经完成的变化。

**亮点:** 简洁的对比句式,深刻总结了人物的人生感悟,言简意赅。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: Neither...nor... 结构

**原句:** "Neither wealth nor status defines an actor or artist."

**聚焦:** Neither...nor... 的否定并列

**用法说明:**
"Neither...nor..." 表示"既不...也不...",用于连接两个否定的并列成分。当这个结构作主语时,谓语动词通常与靠近的名词保持一致(就近原则),但在正式写作中,如果两个名词都是单数,谓语动词用单数。这个结构比使用两个 not 更加简洁和正式。

**主谓一致:**
- Neither wealth nor status defines... (两个单数→单数动词)
- Neither he nor they are... (复数靠近→复数动词)

**可替换句:** "Wealth doesn't define an actor or artist, and status doesn't either." (使用两个否定句,但不如原句简洁)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 比较级的强化

**原句:** "He'd gained so much more than he'd lost."

**聚焦:** So much more 强化比较

**用法说明:**
在比较结构中,"so much" 可以用来强化 "more",表示程度远超预期。"So much more" 比简单的 "more" 更有感情色彩,强调差距之大。这种结构常用于表达惊讶、感激或强烈的对比。

**程度对比:**
- More than: 比...更多(中性)
- Much more than: 多得多(强调)
- So much more than: 远远超过(最强调)

**可替换句:** "He'd gained far more than he'd lost." (使用 far 代替 so much,意思相近)
