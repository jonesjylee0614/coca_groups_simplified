## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Dr. Wei arrived in the small **village** /ˈvɪlɪdʒ/ (n. 村庄) during autumn, when leaves fell like a gentle **strain** /streɪn/ (n. 压力；拉紧) against the windows. Her **company** /ˈkʌmpəni/ (n. 公司；陪伴) had sent her to assess the **environmental** /ɪnˌvaɪrənˈmentl/ (adj. 环境的) impact on local health. She had **no** /noʊ/ **objection** /əbˈdʒekʃn/ (n. 反对) to the assignment, though the **lack** /læk/ (n./v. 缺乏) of modern equipment made her **curious** /ˈkjʊriəs/ (adj. 好奇的).

The first **thing** /θɪŋ/ (n. 事物) she noticed was the old **grocery** /ˈɡroʊsəri/ (n. 杂货店) store **at** /æt/ the **village** center. **Inside** /ɪnˈsaɪd/, Mrs. Lin sold **items** /ˈaɪtəmz/ from the **surface** /ˈsɜːrfəs/ (n. 表面) of wooden **shelves** /ʃelvz/ while humming **lyrics** /ˈlɪrɪks/ (n. 歌词) from old songs. She had been **part** /pɑːrt/ (n. 部分) of this community for **decades** /ˈdekeɪdz/, watching the **migration** /maɪˈɡreɪʃn/ (n. 迁移) of young people to **cities** /ˈsɪtiz/. "They all **leave** /liːv/," she said. "Looking for **cures** /kjʊrz/ (n. 治愈) to problems that **don't** /doʊnt/ **exist** /ɪɡˈzɪst/."

Dr. Wei **spent** /spent/ her days **collecting** /kəˈlektɪŋ/ **samples** /ˈsæmplz/ near the **pines** /paɪnz/ (n. 松树) and reading **literature** /ˈlɪtərətʃər/ (n. 文学；文献) about traditional remedies. The **minimum** /ˈmɪnɪməm/ (adj./n. 最小的；最低限度) she **could** /kʊd/ **do** /duː/ was understand the **local** /ˈloʊkl/ **perspective** /pərˈspektɪv/. She **noticed** /ˈnoʊtɪst/ that **pollution** /pəˈluːʃn/ had **affected** /əˈfektɪd/ (v. 影响—affect的过去式) the **water** /ˈwɔːtər/, **causing** /ˈkɔːzɪŋ/ a **strange** /streɪndʒ/ **strain** of illness.

One **evening** /ˈiːvnɪŋ/, Mrs. Lin **invited** /ɪnˈvaɪtɪd/ Dr. Wei to her home. On the table sat a small **doll** /dɑːl/ (n. 娃娃) her **granddaughter** /ˈɡrændˌdɔːtər/ had **made** /meɪd/. Beside it was a **CD** /ˌsiː ˈdiː/ (n. 光盘) of local music. "This **village**," Mrs. Lin said, "has survived because we **understand** /ˌʌndərˈstænd/ the **connection** /kəˈnekʃn/ between **nature** /ˈneɪtʃər/ and **healing** /ˈhiːlɪŋ/. Your **modern** /ˈmɑːdərn/ science can **find** /faɪnd/ the **cure**, but we know the **cause** /kɔːz/."

Dr. Wei **felt** /felt/ a **tear** /tɪr/ (n. 眼泪) form. She **realized** /ˈriːəlaɪzd/ that her work wasn't **about** /əˈbaʊt/ **proving** /ˈpruːvɪŋ/ **ideology** /ˌaɪdiˈɑːlədʒi/ (n. 意识形态；思想体系) but about **protecting** /prəˈtektɪŋ/ **lives** /laɪvz/. **Each** /iːtʃ/ **particle** /ˈpɑːrtɪkl/ (n. 微粒；粒子) of **pollution** /pəˈluːʃn/ **carried** /ˈkærid/ **weight** /weɪt/. In that **moment** /ˈmoʊmənt/ (n. 时刻), she **understood** /ˌʌndərˈstʊd/ what Mrs. Lin **meant** /ment/: true **environmental** **work** /wɜːrk/ wasn't **about** /əˈbaʊt/ **data** /ˈdeɪtə/ alone—it was **about** /əˈbaʊt/ **caring** /ˈkerɪŋ/ for **people** /ˈpiːpl/.

She **returned** /rɪˈtɜːrnd/ to the **city** /ˈsɪti/ with a **full** /fʊl/ **report** /rɪˈpɔːrt/, **rather** /ˈræðər/ (adv. 相当；宁可) **different** /ˈdɪfrənt/ from what her **company** **expected** /ɪkˈspektɪd/. She **argued** /ˈɑːrɡjuːd/ that the **village** **needed** /ˈniːdɪd/ **clean** /kliːn/ **water** /ˈwɔːtər/, **not** /nɑːt/ **just** /dʒʌst/ **studies** /ˈstʌdiz/. Her **objection** /əbˈdʒekʃn/ to **delay** /dɪˈleɪ/ was **strong** /strɔːŋ/. **Within** /wɪˈðɪn/ **months** /mʌnθs/, the **project** /ˈprɑːdʒekt/ was **approved** /əˈpruːvd/. The **village** **would** /wʊd/ **get** /ɡet/ its **cure**.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

魏博士在秋天到达小村庄，落叶像轻柔的拉力般拍打着窗户。她的公司派她来评估对当地健康的环境影响。她对这项任务没有异议，尽管现代设备的缺乏让她感到好奇。

她注意到的第一件事是村中心的旧杂货店。在里面，林太太在木架表面售卖物品，同时哼着旧歌的歌词。她是这个社区的一部分已有数十年，目睹了年轻人向城市的迁移。"他们都离开了，"她说。"寻找不存在的问题的治愈方法。"

魏博士白天在松树附近收集样本，阅读关于传统疗法的文献。她至少能做的是理解当地的视角。她注意到污染影响了水源，导致了一种奇怪的疾病压力。

一天晚上，林太太邀请魏博士到她家。桌上放着她孙女制作的小娃娃。旁边是一张当地音乐的光盘。"这个村庄，"林太太说，"之所以幸存，是因为我们理解自然与治愈之间的联系。你的现代科学可以找到治愈方法，但我们知道原因。"

魏博士感到眼泪形成。她意识到她的工作不是关于证明意识形态，而是关于保护生命。每一个污染微粒都承载着重量。在那一刻，她理解了林太太的意思：真正的环境工作不仅仅关于数据——它关于关心人们。

她带着一份完整的报告返回城市，与她公司期望的相当不同。她主张村庄需要清洁的水，而不仅仅是研究。她对延迟的反对很强烈。几个月内，项目获得了批准。村庄将得到它的治愈。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子1
**原句：** "Dr. Wei arrived in the small village during autumn, when leaves fell like a gentle strain against the windows."

**分析：** 这句使用了时间状语从句（when...）和明喻（like a gentle strain）。"strain"在这里创造性地用作比喻，将落叶拍打窗户比作轻柔的拉力。

**亮点：** 
- 感官描写营造氛围
- "strain"一词双关：既是物理意义的压力，也暗示后文将出现的压力主题
- 定语从句增加句子层次

---

### 句子2
**原句：** "They all leave, looking for cures to problems that don't exist."

**分析：** 现在分词短语"looking for"作伴随状语。定语从句"that don't exist"修饰"problems"。

**亮点：** 
- 简洁有力地批评了盲目城市化
- "cures to problems that don't exist"是悖论式表达，富有哲理
- 体现了乡村vs城市的主题

---

### 句子3
**原句：** "The minimum she could do was understand the local perspective."

**分析：** 主语是"The minimum"，后接定语从句"she could do"，表语是"understand..."。这种结构强调最基本的要求。

**亮点：** 
- "minimum"作主语的用法较特别，强调谦逊
- 暗示Dr. Wei的态度转变：从科学优越感到愿意学习
-体现了尊重本地知识的重要性

---

### 句子4
**原句：** "Each particle of pollution carried weight."

**分析：** 简单句，但"carried weight"是双关表达。字面意思是"有重量"，引申义是"有重要性、有影响"。

**亮点：** 
- 双关修辞增强表达力
- 将抽象的"影响"具体化为"weight"
- 呼应环境主题：每一个微粒都重要

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦1：Rather的多重用法

**原句：** "She returned to the city with a full report, rather different from what her company expected."

**聚焦：** Rather作为副词的用法

**用法说明：**

1. **Rather = 相当、颇（修饰形容词/副词）**
   - It's **rather** cold today. (相当冷)
   - She speaks **rather** quickly. (相当快)

2. **Rather than = 而不是（表对比选择）**
   - I prefer tea **rather than** coffee.
   - She decided to walk **rather than** take the bus.

3. **Would rather = 宁愿（表偏好）**
   - I **would rather** stay home.
   - She'd **rather** not discuss it.

**原句分析：**
"rather different" 使用了用法1，"rather"修饰形容词"different"，表示"相当不同"。这比"very different"稍微正式，暗示程度之大超出预期。

**可替换句：**
- "...a report quite different from..." (quite较口语)
- "...a report significantly different from..." (更正式)

---

### 聚焦2：现在分词作状语

**原句：** "She spent her days collecting samples near the pines and reading literature about traditional remedies."

**聚焦：** 现在分词（collecting, reading）作方式状语

**用法说明：**
现在分词可以描述主句动作的方式、伴随情况或原因。这里"collecting"和"reading"说明她如何度过时间。

**结构特点：**
- 主句：She spent her days
- 方式状语1：collecting samples...
- 并列方式状语2：(and) reading literature...

**逻辑关系：**
- 主语一致：collecting和reading的逻辑主语都是"she"
- 时间同步：与主句动作同时发生
- 两个分词并列，展示多重活动

**可替换句：**
- "She spent her days **in** collecting samples..." (介词短语，较正式)
- "She collected samples and read literature..." (并列动词，但失去"spend time doing"的重点)

### 6.3 写作任务 (Writing Prompt)

Write a short paragraph (80-100 words) about a time when local knowledge or traditional wisdom helped solve a problem that modern methods couldn't. Use at least 5 words from this group's vocabulary list.

**参考示例：**
In our village, we faced a curious problem: crops wouldn't grow despite expensive fertilizers. A local farmer objected to more chemicals, saying we lacked understanding of the soil. He showed us literature from his grandfather about crop rotation and pine needles as natural fertilizer. This rather simple cure worked better than modern products. It was a moment that taught me environmental solutions sometimes come from respecting traditional knowledge, not just from a company's laboratory. Each particle of wisdom from the past carries weight.

---

### 6.4 讨论问题 (Discussion)

**Question:** Mrs. Lin suggests that understanding the "connection between nature and healing" is more important than modern science's search for cures. Do you think traditional knowledge and modern science should work together, or is one approach superior? How can we balance respecting tradition with embracing innovation?

**思考提示：**
- Consider examples where traditional knowledge proved valuable
- Think about areas where modern science has made breakthroughs traditional methods couldn't
- Reflect on whether the opposition between "traditional" and "modern" is false—can they complement each other?
- Discuss Dr. Wei's realization that data alone isn't enough—what else is needed?
- Consider migration from villages to cities: what is lost and gained?
- Think about environmental ideology: whose perspective matters when making decisions?
