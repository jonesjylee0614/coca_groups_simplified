## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Lisa was a **rookie** /ˈrʊki/ (n. 新手；菜鸟) **engineer** /ˌendʒɪˈnɪr/ (n. 工程师) fresh out of college. She had **powerful** /ˈpaʊərfl/ (adj. 强大的；有力的) skills in designing water systems, but no real-world experience. Her **income** /ˈɪnkʌm/ (n. 收入；所得) was low, and she lived **simply** /ˈsɪmpli/ (adv. 简单地；仅仅). But she wanted to do more than **gain** /ɡeɪn/ (v./n. 获得；增加) money—she wanted to help people.

One day, her professor called. "Lisa, I want to **propose** /prəˈpoʊz/ (v. 提议；求婚) a project. There's a **tribal** /ˈtraɪbl/ (adj. 部落的；种族的) village living in **poverty** /ˈpɑːvərti/ (n. 贫困；贫穷). They don't have clean water. The **scope** /skoʊp/ (n. 范围；机会) of the work is large, but it's meaningful. Are you interested?"

Lisa thought **quietly** /ˈkwaɪətli/ (adv. 安静地；平静地) for a moment. "**Okay** /ˌoʊˈkeɪ/ (adj./adv./interj. 好的；可以)," she said. "I'll do it. But I'll need help. I can't do this alone."

Her professor smiled. "You'll have a team. But you'll be in charge. **Trust** /trʌst/ (v./n. 信任；信赖) yourself."

When Lisa arrived at the village, she was surprised by the **opposition** /ˌɑːpəˈzɪʃn/ (n. 反对；对立) she faced. Some villagers didn't **trust** outsiders. "Why should we believe you?" one elder asked. "Many people **propose** ideas, but nothing changes. We don't have **enough** /ɪˈnʌf/ (adj./adv./pron. 足够的；充分) **trust** left."

Lisa understood. She needed to show, not just tell. She started **walking** /ˈwɔːkɪŋ/ (v./n. 行走；步行) through the village every day, talking to people, learning their needs. She didn't act like she knew everything. She was **simply** a learner.

**Suddenly** /ˈsʌdnli/ (adv. 突然地；意外地), an old woman approached her. "You're different," she said. "You listen. **Okay**, I'll help you. But you must **donate** /ˈdoʊneɪt/ (v. 捐赠；捐献) your time, not just your knowledge."

Lisa agreed. Over the next months, she worked with the villagers to build a water system. The **hardware** /ˈhɑːrdwer/ (n. 硬件；五金器具) was **simple**—pipes, filters, and storage tanks. But the **art** /ɑːrt/ (n. 艺术；技术) of implementation required patience and care. She had to **regulate** /ˈreɡjuleɪt/ (v. 调节；管理) water flow, test quality, and train people to maintain the system.

There were challenges. One man became her **opponent** /əˈpoʊnənt/ (n. 对手；反对者)。"This won't work," he said. "It's too complex. We're not engineers."

Lisa faced him calmly. "You're right—you're not engineers. But you're **powerful** problem-solvers. You've survived here for generations. I'm just here to help you add one more tool."

Slowly, the **opposition** faded. People began to see results—clean water flowing, children getting healthier. The village **gained** confidence. They even added their own **tag** /tæɡ/ (n. 标签；标记) to the water tank: "Built by our hands, with Lisa's guidance."

At the end of the project, the professor visited. "Lisa, this is a real **accomplishment** /əˈkɑːmplɪʃmənt/ (n. 成就；完成)," he said. "You've shown that engineering isn't just about machines. It's about trust and community."

Lisa felt proud, but also humble. She had learned that being a **rookie** wasn't a weakness. It meant she was open to learning. Her **income** was still small, but her heart was full. She had done something **round** /raʊnd/ (adj./n./prep. 圆的；周围；大约) and complete—a project that changed lives.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

丽莎是一名刚从大学毕业的新手工程师。她在设计供水系统方面有强大的技能，但没有实际经验。她的收入很低，生活很简单。但她想做的不仅仅是赚钱——她想帮助人们。

一天,她的教授打电话来。"丽莎,我想提议一个项目。有一个部落村庄生活在贫困中。他们没有干净的水。工作范围很大，但很有意义。你有兴趣吗？"

丽莎静静地想了一会儿。"好的，"她说。"我会做的。但我需要帮助。我不能独自完成。"

她的教授微笑了。"你会有一个团队。但你将负责。相信自己。"

当丽莎到达村庄时，她对所面临的反对感到惊讶。一些村民不信任外来者。"我们为什么要相信你？"一位长老问。"许多人提出想法，但什么都没有改变。我们没有足够的信任了。"

丽莎理解。她需要展示，而不仅仅是告诉。她开始每天在村庄里走动，与人们交谈，了解他们的需求。她没有表现得好像她什么都知道。她只是一个学习者。

突然，一位老妇人走近她。"你不一样，"她说。"你会倾听。好吧，我会帮你。但你必须捐献你的时间，而不仅仅是你的知识。"

丽莎同意了。在接下来的几个月里，她与村民们一起建造供水系统。硬件很简单——管道、过滤器和储水罐。但实施的技术需要耐心和关怀。她必须调节水流、测试质量，并培训人们维护系统。

有挑战。一个男人成为了她的对手。"这不会起作用，"他说。"太复杂了。我们不是工程师。"

丽莎平静地面对他。"你说得对——你们不是工程师。但你们是强大的问题解决者。你们在这里生存了几代人。我只是来帮助你们增加一个工具。"

慢慢地，反对消失了。人们开始看到结果——清洁的水流动，孩子们变得更健康。村庄获得了信心。他们甚至在水箱上加了自己的标签："由我们的双手建造，有丽莎的指导。"

项目结束时，教授来访。"丽莎，这是一个真正的成就，"他说。"你已经证明了工程不仅仅是关于机器。它是关于信任和社区。"

丽莎感到自豪，但也很谦虚。她了解到，作为一个新手并不是弱点。这意味着她愿意学习。她的收入仍然很少，但她的心是满的。她已经做了一些完整的事情——一个改变生活的项目。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "But she wanted to do more than gain money—she wanted to help people."

**分析:** "more than" 在这里表示"不仅仅是；超过"。破折号后的内容对前文进行解释和强化。这种结构清晰地表达了主人公的价值观。

**亮点:** 使用 "more than" + 动词原形的结构可以有效地表达"不仅仅是做某事"的意思。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "She needed to show, not just tell."

**分析:** 这是一个简洁有力的对比句，省略了重复的成分（she needed to）。"Show, not tell" 是写作和生活中的经典原则，意为用行动而非语言证明。

**亮点:** 这种省略式对比句非常简练，适合用来表达行动原则或人生哲理。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "You're not engineers. But you're powerful problem-solvers."

**分析:** 两个简短的句子形成对比。先否定一个身份（not engineers），再肯定另一个身份（powerful problem-solvers）。这种结构在鼓励和说服时非常有效。

**亮点:** 短句 + 转折 + 短句的结构有很强的节奏感和说服力。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "She had done something round and complete—a project that changed lives."

**分析:** "Round and complete" 使用形容词的比喻意义，表示"完整圆满"。破折号后的同位语对前文进行具体说明。这是一个富有文学性的结尾句。

**亮点:** 用 "round" 的比喻意义表示"完整"，是一种诗意的表达方式。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: More than 的多种用法

**原句:** "She wanted to do more than gain money."

**聚焦:** More than 的不同含义

**用法说明:**
"More than" 是一个多功能短语，有多种含义：

1. **比...更多；超过**（数量）
   - More than 100 people came.
   - She has more than enough money.

2. **不仅仅是；不只是**
   - He is more than a teacher—he's a friend.
   - This is more than just a job.

3. **非常；极其**（用于形容词前）
   - I'm more than happy to help.
   - She was more than willing.

4. **比...更**（比较级）
   - She works more than he does.
   - I love you more than words can say.

**可替换句:** "She wanted to do something beyond gaining money." 或 "She wanted not just to gain money, but to help people."

---

### 聚焦点 2: 名词作定语（复合名词）

**原句:** "She had powerful skills in designing water systems."

**聚焦:** 名词作定语构成复合名词

**用法说明:**
英语中常用"名词 + 名词"的结构，前面的名词作定语修饰后面的名词：

**常见模式:**
1. **材料 + 物品**: water bottle（水瓶）, glass door（玻璃门）
2. **地点 + 物品**: kitchen table（厨房桌子）, mountain road（山路）
3. **时间 + 物品**: summer vacation（暑假）, morning news（晨间新闻）
4. **用途 + 物品**: coffee cup（咖啡杯）, water system（供水系统）

**注意事项:**
- 作定语的名词通常用单数：a shoe store（鞋店），不是 shoes store
- 例外：sports center, clothes shop（因为这些词本身常用复数形式）
- 如果关系复杂，用 "of" 结构：the roof of the house

**例句:**
- book store（书店）
- car park（停车场）
- love story（爱情故事）
- water supply（供水）
