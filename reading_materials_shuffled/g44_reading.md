**#SliceOfLife** – A story of fathers and sons

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

On **a** /ə/ (art. 一个) **hot** /hɑːt/ (adj. 热的) afternoon, Daniel sat in **his** /hɪz/ (pron. 他的) **school** /skuːl/ (n. 学校) cafeteria, working on a **report** /rɪˈpɔːrt/ (n. 报告) for **his** science class. The assignment was to interview someone about their work and **combine** /kəmˈbaɪn/ (v. 结合) personal stories with research. Daniel had chosen **his** **father** /ˈfɑːðər/ (n. 父亲)—or "**dad**" /dæd/ (n. 爸爸) as he usually called him—who owned a small **website** /ˈwebsaɪt/ (n. 网站) design business.

The relationship between them had become distant. Daniel's **dad** rarely came home before dinner, and when he did, conversations would **disappear** /ˌdɪsəˈpɪr/ (v. 消失) into awkward silence. Daniel wished he could **roll** /roʊl/ (v. 滚动) back time to when they used to **clean** /kliːn/ (v. 打扫) the garage together on Saturdays, talking about everything and nothing.

As he typed, Daniel remembered something his teacher, Mr. Chen, had said: "**Friendship** /ˈfrendʃɪp/ (n. 友谊) isn't just between peers—it can exist between any two people willing to try." That gave Daniel an idea. What if he approached this **report** not as a **physical** /ˈfɪzɪkl/ (adj. 身体的) assignment but as a bridge?

That evening, Daniel knocked on the door of **his** **father**'s study. "**Dad**, I need to interview you for school. Can we talk?" His **father** looked up from the computer screen, surprised. "Sure, son. What's the **charge**?" /tʃɑːrdʒ/ (n. 费用；指控) He joked, trying to lighten the mood. Daniel smiled, relieved.

They talked for hours. His **dad** explained the **constitutional** /ˌkɑːnstɪˈtuːʃənl/ (adj. 宪法的) right to free speech and how **it** /ɪt/ (pron. 它) shaped **his** work creating platforms for small voices. He shared a **recipe** /ˈresəpi/ (n. 食谱；方法) for success: **attribute** /əˈtrɪbjuːt/ (v. 归因于) failures to learning, not weakness. He even pulled up **his** **website** to show Daniel a **review** /rɪˈvjuː/ (n. 评论) from a client: "Your work gave us a voice."

"**Dad**, were you ever scared?" Daniel asked. His **father** paused, then nodded. "A **lot** /lɑːt/ (n. 许多). But you have to be **brave** /breɪv/ (adj. 勇敢的) even when you're terrified." He showed Daniel a legal **disclosure** /dɪsˈkloʊʒər/ (n. 披露) document from years ago. "I almost lost everything once. But I didn't **disappear**. I kept going."

Daniel felt something **slide** /slaɪd/ (v. 滑动) into place in **his** heart. This wasn't just an interview—**it** was a moment of connection he'd been missing. "Thanks, **Dad**," he said quietly. "This helps **a** **lot**."

His **father** reached over and ruffled **his** hair. "Anytime, son. Let's do this more often." And for the first time in months, Daniel felt like he had **his** **dad** back.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

在一个炎热的下午,丹尼尔坐在学校的自助餐厅里,为他的科学课写一份报告。作业要求是采访某人的工作,并将个人故事与研究结合起来。丹尼尔选择了他的父亲——或者像他通常叫的"爸爸"——他拥有一家小型网站设计公司。

他们之间的关系变得疏远了。丹尼尔的爸爸很少在晚饭前回家,即使回来了,对话也会消失在尴尬的沉默中。丹尼尔希望他能倒转时间,回到他们过去在星期六一起打扫车库的时候,谈论所有的事和无关紧要的事。

在打字时,丹尼尔想起了他的老师陈先生说过的话:"友谊不仅仅存在于同龄人之间——它可以存在于任何两个愿意尝试的人之间。"这给了丹尼尔一个想法。如果他把这份报告不仅仅当作一个实际的作业,而是当作一座桥梁呢?

那天晚上,丹尼尔敲了敲父亲书房的门。"爸爸,我需要为学校采访你。我们能谈谈吗?"他的父亲从电脑屏幕上抬起头来,很惊讶。"当然,儿子。费用是多少?"他开玩笑说,试图缓和气氛。丹尼尔笑了,松了一口气。

他们谈了几个小时。他的爸爸解释了言论自由的宪法权利,以及它如何影响他为小众声音创建平台的工作。他分享了成功的秘诀:把失败归因于学习,而不是软弱。他甚至打开了他的网站,向丹尼尔展示一位客户的评论:"你的工作给了我们一个声音。"

"爸爸,你害怕过吗?"丹尼尔问。他的父亲停顿了一下,然后点了点头。"很多次。但即使你很害怕,你也必须勇敢。"他给丹尼尔看了几年前的一份法律披露文件。"我曾经差点失去一切。但我没有消失。我继续前进。"

丹尼尔感到有什么东西在他心中滑入了正确的位置。这不仅仅是一次采访——这是他一直缺失的连接时刻。"谢谢你,爸爸,"他轻声说。"这帮助很大。"

他的父亲伸手揉了揉他的头发。"随时,儿子。让我们多做这样的事。"几个月来第一次,丹尼尔感觉他找回了他的爸爸。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The assignment was to interview someone about their work and combine personal stories with research."

**分析:** 使用不定式 "to interview" 作表语,说明作业的内容。"combine A with B" 是固定搭配,表示"将A与B结合"。

**亮点:** 清晰的目的陈述为故事发展做铺垫,让读者理解主人公的动机。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Daniel wished he could roll back time to when they used to clean the garage together on Saturdays."

**分析:** "wish + could + 动词原形" 表示对现在或将来不太可能实现的愿望。"used to" 表示过去的习惯。"roll back time" 是生动的比喻表达。

**亮点:** 这句话饱含情感,通过具体的回忆(打扫车库)来展现父子关系的变化。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "What if he approached this report not as a physical assignment but as a bridge?"

**分析:** "What if" 引导假设性问题,是思考和转折的标志。"not as A but as B" 强调对比,展示思维的转变。

**亮点:** 将报告比作"桥梁"是优美的隐喻,体现了主人公认识的深化。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Daniel felt something slide into place in his heart."

**分析:** "feel + 宾语 + 动词原形" 结构,生动描述内心的感受。"slide into place" 意为"滑入正确位置",是机械领域借用到情感描写的比喻。

**亮点:** 这种具象化的情感描写让抽象的"理解"或"连接"变得可感可触。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "wish" 虚拟语气

**原句:** "Daniel wished he could roll back time to when they used to clean the garage together."

**聚焦:** wish + 虚拟语气

**用法说明:**
"wish" 后接虚拟语气表示与现实相反的愿望。这里用 "could + 动词原形" 表示对现在能力或可能性的假设(实际上无法做到)。

**虚拟语气时态对比:**
- 对现在的愿望: "I wish I could fly." (现在不能飞)
- 对过去的愿望: "I wish I had studied harder." (过去没有努力学习)
- 对将来的愿望: "I wish you would visit more often." (希望将来更常来访)

**可替换句:** "Daniel wanted to turn back time to when they used to clean the garage together." (不用虚拟语气,较直白)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "not as A but as B" 对比结构

**原句:** "What if he approached this report not as a physical assignment but as a bridge?"

**聚焦:** not as...but as... 强调身份或性质的对比

**用法说明:**
这个结构用来否定一种看法,强调另一种看法。"as" 在这里表示"作为",整个结构强调看待事物的不同角度。

**结构变化:**
- 完整形式: "not as A but as B"
- 简化形式: "not A but B"
- 强调形式: "B rather than A"

**可替换句:** "What if he saw this report as a bridge rather than just a physical assignment?" (用 "rather than" 表达)
