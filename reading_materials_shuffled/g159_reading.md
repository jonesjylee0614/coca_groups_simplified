**#SliceOfLife** – A story of craft, legacy, and finding one's place

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **firm** /fɜːrm/ (n./adj. 公司;坚固的;坚定的) had been in the Chen family for three generations. It wasn't a large business—just a small workshop where they worked with **leather** /ˈleðər/ (n. 皮革), making bags, belts, and shoes by hand. Li Chen stood at the workbench, watching her grandfather's hands as he **cut** /kʌt/ (v./n. 切;割;削减) a piece of brown **leather** with practiced ease. His movements were steady and **firm**, never hesitating.

"**Hold** /hoʊld/ (v./n. 握住;保持;持有) it like this," he said, showing her how to position the knife. "The **cut** must be **firm** but controlled. If you press too hard, you'll **damage** the **leather**. Too soft, and the **cut** won't be **clean**."

Li tried to follow his instructions, but her hands shook slightly. She was a university student studying business, and her family expected her to take over the **firm** one day. But she had **doubts**. In a **modern** world, who still wanted handmade **leather** goods? **Yesterday**, her friends had been talking about buying **cheap** **synthetic** bags online. The idea of spending her life in this small workshop felt limiting.

"Grandpa," she said, putting down the knife, "do you ever think about how things have changed? The **average** /ˈævərɪdʒ/ (adj./n. 平均的;平均数) person today doesn't care about handmade items. They want things **cheap** and **fast**."

Her grandfather smiled, his weathered face showing **lines** of experience. "That's true in many **countries** /ˈkʌntriz/ (n. 国家[country的复数])," he said. "But there will always be people who appreciate quality. The **question** is: do you want to serve the **average** customer, or the person who understands the **worth** /wɜːrθ/ (n./adj. 价值;值得的) of true craft?"

Li thought about this as she watched him work. He was making a bag for a **banker** /ˈbæŋkər/ (n. 银行家), someone who could **afford** expensive things but chose to **come** here instead of buying **designer** brands. "Why do they **come** here?" she asked.

"Because of the **link** /lɪŋk/ (n./v. 联系;连接) between maker and object," her grandfather explained. "When I make something, I put part of myself into it. The person who uses it can **feel** that. It's not just a bag—it's a **connection**."

Li wanted to understand, but she felt **torn**. **Yesterday**, she had received a job offer from a large **firm** in the city, working in **accounting** /əˈkaʊntɪŋ/ (n. 会计;会计学). The **salary** would be **substantial**, much more than the workshop could ever **pay**. It would be a **competitive** /kəmˈpetətɪv/ (adj. 竞争的;有竞争力的) position, something her friends would **admire**.

That evening, Li's father **came** home from meeting with a client. "The **principal** /ˈprɪnsəpl/ (n./adj. 校长;负责人;主要的) of the art school wants to order **twenty** bags for their **graduation** ceremony," he said. "He specifically asked for our work because he wants to teach students about **quality**."

Li's mother, who helped manage the **firm**'s business side, smiled. "That's wonderful. But Li, have you made a **decision** about the job offer? They need to know **soon**."

Everyone looked at Li. She felt the **pressure** of their expectations. "I don't know," she admitted. "Part of me wants to **accept** the job. It's **stable**, it's **modern**. But part of me feels like I'd be **abandoning** something **important**."

Her grandmother, who rarely spoke at dinner, put down her **chopsticks**. "When I was young," she said, "I wanted to **leave** this **country** life and **move** to the city. I thought working with **leather** was **old-fashioned**. But then your grandfather showed me something I hadn't **realized**."

"What was that?" Li asked.

"**Transformation** /ˌtrænsfərˈmeɪʃn/ (n. 转变;变化)," her grandmother said. "Taking a piece of **leather**—which is just animal **skin**, really—and **transforming** it into something **beautiful** and **useful**. That's not just **work**. That's **art**. That's **legacy**."

Li thought about this word: **transformation**. She **realized** /ˈriːəlaɪzd/ (v. 意识到;实现[realize的过去式]) it applied to more than just **leather**. Her grandfather's **firm** had **transformed** over **decades**, adapting to changes while keeping its **core** **values**. Maybe that's what she needed to do—not **choose** between **tradition** and **modernity**, but **find** /faɪnd/ (v. 找到;发现) a way to **link** them.

"Can I try again?" she asked her grandfather, picking up the **knife**. This time, she **held** it more **firmly**, remembering his **advice**. She **cut** through the **leather**, and the line was **cleaner** than **before**. Not **perfect**, but better.

"Good," her grandfather said. "You're **learning**. The **leather** will **teach** you **patience**. Every **mistake** makes you **better**."

Over the next few weeks, Li **continued** to **work** at the workshop while **considering** her **decision**. She **learned** to **cut** **leather** **cleanly**, to **hold** pieces **firmly** while **stitching** them together, to **judge** when a **piece** was **finished**. The **work** was **physical** and **demanding**, but she **found** something **satisfying** in it—the **concrete** **result** of her **efforts**.

One afternoon, a customer **came** in. She was a young **woman**, maybe a few years older than Li, wearing a **leather** **bag** made by Li's grandfather **years** ago. "I wanted to **ask** if you could **repair** this," she said. "I've had it for **ten** **years**, and it's still my **favorite**. But the **strap** needs **fixing**."

Li's grandfather **examined** the bag. "I **remember** making this," he said. "I **cut** each **piece** by **hand**, **selected** the **color** **carefully**. I'm **glad** it's **served** you **well**."

As Li watched them **talk**, she **realized** something. This wasn't just about **selling** products. It was about **relationships** that **lasted** **years**, about **objects** that **held** **memories**, about **craft** that **connected** **people** across **time**. You couldn't **find** that in a **competitive** **corporate** job, no **matter** how **high** the **salary**.

That evening, Li **made** her **decision**. She **called** the **firm** that had **offered** her the job. "Thank you for the **opportunity**," she said, "but I've **decided** to **decline**. I'm going to **stay** with my **family**'s **firm**."

Her **parents** were **surprised** but **supportive**. "Are you **sure**?" her mother asked. "The **wealth** /welθ/ (n. 财富) you could **accumulate** at that job would be **considerable**."

"I'm **sure**," Li said. "But I want to make some **changes**. I want to **find** **ways** to **link** our **traditional** **craft** with **modern** **business**. Maybe we can **create** an **online** **presence**, **reach** **customers** who **appreciate** **quality** but **live** far from here. We can **maintain** our **standards** while **adapting** to **modern** **times**."

Her grandfather **listened** **carefully**. "That's **wise**," he said. "A **firm** **foundation** in **tradition**, but **willingness** to **change**. That's how we've **survived** this **long**."

Li **started** **working** on her **plan**. She **learned** **photography** and **created** **beautiful** **images** of their **products**. She **wrote** **descriptions** that **explained** the **craft**, the **hours** of **work**, the **care** in each **piece**. She **found** **platforms** where **people** who **valued** **quality** could **find** them. It was a **different** kind of **work** from what her grandfather did, but it was **equally** **important**.

**Versus** /ˈvɜːrsəs/ (prep. 对抗;与...相对) **abandoning** her **family**'s **tradition**, Li was **helping** it **evolve**. The **firm** wasn't just a **place** where they **cut** **leather** and **made** **bags**. It was a **place** where **tradition** and **innovation** **met**, where **grandfather** and **granddaughter** **worked** together, each **contributing** their **strengths**.

One day, a **food** **blogger** who had **discovered** their **workshop** wrote: "In a **world** where everything is **mass**-**produced**, the Chen **family**'s **firm** **stands** as a **reminder** of what **craftsmanship** means. Each **piece** is **unique**, made with **care** that you can **feel** when you **hold** it. The **transformation** from **simple** **leather** to **finished** **product** is **remarkable**."

Li **read** the **review** to her grandfather. He **smiled**. "See?" he said. "You **found** the **link** between **old** and **new**. You didn't **defeat** /dɪˈfiːt/ (v./n. 击败;失败) the **challenge**; you **transformed** it."

**Months** later, Li stood at the **workbench**, **holding** a **piece** of **leather**, about to make her **first** **complete** **bag** **alone**. Her **hands** were **steady**, her **cut** would be **firm**. She **thought** about her **journey**—from **doubt** to **certainty**, from **wanting** to **leave** to **choosing** to **stay**, from **seeing** the **firm** as a **limitation** to **understanding** it as a **gift**.

As she **cut** the **leather**, Li **realized** that **craftsmanship** wasn't just about **making** **things** with your **hands**. It was about **making** **choices** with your **heart**. It was about **holding** onto what **mattered** while **being** **willing** to **change**. It was about **finding** your **place** in a **story** that **began** **before** you and would **continue** **after** you.

The **leather** **beneath** her **hands** felt **solid**, **real**. Each **cut** she **made** was a **commitment**, a **statement** that she **believed** in this **work**, this **tradition**, this **connection** between **past** and **future**. And as the **bag** **began** to **take** **shape**, Li **smiled**, **knowing** she had **found** where she **belonged**.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

这家公司在陈家已经传承了三代。它不是一家大企业——只是一个小作坊,他们手工制作皮革制品,制作包、腰带和鞋子。李晨站在工作台旁,看着祖父熟练地切割一块棕色皮革。他的动作稳定而坚定,从不犹豫。

"像这样握住,"他说,向她展示如何定位刀。"切割必须坚定但可控。如果你压得太硬,你会损坏皮革。太轻,切口就不会干净。"

李晨试图按照他的指示,但她的手微微颤抖。她是一名学习商业的大学生,家人期望她有一天接管公司。但她有疑虑。在现代世界,谁还想要手工制作的皮革制品?昨天,她的朋友们正在谈论在网上购买便宜的合成包。在这个小作坊度过一生的想法感觉很局限。

"爷爷,"她说,放下刀,"你有没有想过事情如何改变了?今天的普通人不关心手工制品。他们想要便宜和快速的东西。"

她的祖父微笑,他风化的脸上显示出经验的纹路。"这在许多国家都是真的,"他说。"但总会有欣赏质量的人。问题是:你想服务普通客户,还是理解真正工艺价值的人?"

李晨在看他工作时思考着这个问题。他正在为一位银行家做一个包,一个能买得起昂贵东西的人,但选择来这里而不是购买设计师品牌。"他们为什么来这里?"她问。

"因为制造者和物品之间的联系,"她的祖父解释说。"当我制作东西时,我把自己的一部分放进去了。使用它的人能感觉到。这不仅仅是一个包——这是一种连接。"

李晨想理解,但她感到矛盾。昨天,她收到了城市一家大公司的工作邀请,从事会计工作。薪水将是可观的,远远超过作坊能支付的。这将是一个有竞争力的职位,她的朋友们会钦佩的东西。

那天晚上,李晨的父亲与客户会面后回家。"艺术学校的校长想为他们的毕业典礼订购二十个包,"他说。"他特别要求我们的作品,因为他想教学生关于质量。"

李晨的母亲帮助管理公司的业务方面,微笑着说。"那太好了。但李晨,你对工作邀请做出决定了吗?他们需要很快知道。"

每个人都看着李晨。她感到他们期望的压力。"我不知道,"她承认。"我的一部分想接受这份工作。它稳定,它现代。但我的一部分感觉我会放弃一些重要的东西。"

她的祖母很少在晚餐时说话,放下了筷子。"当我年轻时,"她说,"我想离开这个乡村生活搬到城市。我认为用皮革工作是老式的。但后来你祖父向我展示了一些我没有意识到的东西。"

"那是什么?"李晨问。

"转变,"她的祖母说。"拿一块皮革——实际上只是动物皮肤——并将其转变为美丽和有用的东西。那不仅仅是工作。那是艺术。那是遗产。"

李晨想着这个词:转变。她意识到它不仅适用于皮革。她祖父的公司在几十年里转变了,适应变化同时保持其核心价值观。也许这就是她需要做的——不是在传统和现代之间选择,而是找到一种方式将它们联系起来。

"我能再试一次吗?"她问她的祖父,拿起刀。这一次,她握得更坚定了,记住了他的建议。她切过皮革,线条比以前更干净了。不完美,但更好。

"好,"她的祖父说。"你在学习。皮革会教你耐心。每个错误都让你变得更好。"

在接下来的几周里,李晨在考虑决定的同时继续在作坊工作。她学会了干净地切割皮革,在缝合时坚定地握住碎片,判断何时完成一件作品。工作是体力和要求高的,但她在其中发现了令人满意的东西——她努力的具体结果。

一天下午,一位顾客进来了。她是一位年轻女士,也许比李晨大几岁,戴着一个李晨祖父多年前制作的皮包。"我想问你是否能修理这个,"她说。"我已经有它十年了,它仍然是我的最爱。但带子需要修理。"

李晨的祖父检查了包。"我记得制作这个,"他说。"我手工切割每一块,仔细选择颜色。我很高兴它很好地为你服务。"

当李晨看着他们交谈时,她意识到了一些东西。这不仅仅是销售产品。这是关于持续多年的关系,关于承载记忆的物品,关于跨越时间连接人们的工艺。无论薪水多高,你都无法在有竞争力的企业工作中找到这些。

那天晚上,李晨做出了决定。她打电话给提供她工作的公司。"谢谢你的机会,"她说,"但我决定拒绝。我将留在我家的公司。"

她的父母感到惊讶但支持。"你确定吗?"她母亲问。"你在那份工作中可以积累的财富将是可观的。"

"我确定,"李晨说。"但我想做一些改变。我想找到将我们传统工艺与现代商业联系起来的方法。也许我们可以创建在线存在,接触到欣赏质量但住得很远的客户。我们可以在适应现代时代的同时保持我们的标准。"

她的祖父仔细听着。"那很明智,"他说。"传统的坚实基础,但愿意改变。这就是我们存活这么久的原因。"

李晨开始制定她的计划。她学习摄影并创建了他们产品的美丽图像。她写了解释工艺、工作时间、每件作品中的关怀的描述。她找到了重视质量的人可以找到他们的平台。这与她祖父所做的工作不同,但同样重要。

与放弃她家族的传统相对,李晨正在帮助它发展。公司不仅仅是一个他们切割皮革和制作包的地方。这是传统和创新相遇的地方,祖父和孙女一起工作的地方,每个人都贡献他们的优势。

有一天,一位发现他们作坊的美食博主写道:"在一个一切都大规模生产的世界里,陈家的公司作为工艺意味着什么的提醒而存在。每件作品都是独特的,用你握住它时能感觉到的关怀制作。从简单皮革到成品的转变是显著的。"

李晨向她的祖父读了这篇评论。他微笑。"看?"他说。"你找到了旧与新之间的联系。你没有击败挑战;你转变了它。"

几个月后,李晨站在工作台旁,握着一块皮革,准备独自制作她的第一个完整的包。她的手很稳,她的切割会很坚定。她想到了她的旅程——从怀疑到确定,从想要离开到选择留下,从把公司视为限制到理解它是礼物。

当她切割皮革时,李晨意识到工艺不仅仅是用手制作东西。它是用心做出选择。它是在愿意改变的同时坚持重要的事情。它是在一个在你之前开始并将在你之后继续的故事中找到你的位置。

她手下的皮革感觉坚实、真实。她做的每一刀都是一种承诺,一种声明,表明她相信这项工作、这种传统、这种过去与未来之间的联系。随着包开始成形,李晨微笑,知道她找到了她的归属。
