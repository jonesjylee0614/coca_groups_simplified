## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Dr. Sarah Kim had built an **impressive** /ɪmˈpresɪv/ (adj. 令人印象深刻的) **career** /kəˈrɪr/ (n. 职业) fighting for justice. **As** /æz/ (conj./prep. 作为；当) an **activist** /ˈæktɪvɪst/ (n. 活动家), she worked to expose systems of **abuse** /əˈbjuːs/ (n./v. 滥用；虐待) and demand **equality** /iˈkwɑːləti/ (n. 平等). Her office displayed a sign: "In a world full of noise, be a voice for the voiceless." People called her their **beloved** /bɪˈlʌvd/ (adj. 挚爱的) champion, though she insisted, "**Darling** /ˈdɑːrlɪŋ/ (n./adj. 亲爱的), I'm just doing what's **right** /raɪt/ (adj. 正确的)."

One case **concerning** /kənˈsɜːrnɪŋ/ (prep./adj. 关于；令人担忧的) a factory caught her attention. Workers described terrible conditions—**no** /noʊ/ (det. 没有) **rest** /rest/ (n./v. 休息), poor pay, and threats against anyone who complained. The owner, a man who saw workers **as** mere tools, had created a system built on power **abuse**. Sarah knew this was more than a legal issue; it was about human **dignity** /ˈdɪɡnəti/ (n. 尊严).

She met with workers who shared their stories. One woman, holding a small **coin** /kɔɪn/ (n. 硬币) her daughter had **given** /ˈɡɪvn/ (v. 给—give的过去分词) her for luck, spoke quietly: "He treats us like we're nothing. When someone tried to speak up, he called them an **offensive word** /əˈfensɪv wɜːrd/ (n. 冒犯性的话) and made threats." Sarah felt anger rise but kept her voice **neutral** /ˈnuːtrəl/ (adj. 中立的；中性的). "Your courage is **impressive**," she said. "Together, we'll make this **right**."

Sarah began building her case. She gathered evidence through every **medium** /ˈmiːdiəm/ (n. 媒介；中等) available—photos, recordings, testimony. The situation was **concerning** to **representatives** /ˌreprɪˈzentətɪvz/ (n. 代表) from **various** /ˈveriəs/ (adj. 各种各样的) organizations. One lawyer offered to work for **credit** /ˈkredɪt/ (n. 信用；赞扬) alone, **saying** /ˈseɪɪŋ/ (v. 说—say的现在分词), "What he's doing isn't just exploitation—the threats of violence make it even worse. These aren't empty words."

The trial brought everything to light. The factory owner's **doctrine** /ˈdɑːktrɪn/ (n. 教义；主义) was simple: **profit** /ˈprɑːfɪt/ (n. 利润) above people. But Sarah presented evidence so **pure** /pjʊr/ (adj. 纯粹的；纯净的) and clear that denial was impossible. She spoke of the **treasure** /ˈtreʒər/ (n./v. 财富；珍视) of human **dignity** /ˈdɪɡnəti/ (n. 尊严), of **innovative** /ˈɪnəveɪtɪv/ (adj. 创新的) solutions that valued both **productivity** /ˌprɑːdʌkˈtɪvəti/ (n. 生产力) and **people** /ˈpiːpl/ (n. 人们). "True **satisfaction** /ˌsætɪsˈfækʃn/ (n. 满意) comes not from **hoarding** /ˈhɔːrdɪŋ/ (v. 囤积) like a **harbor** /ˈhɑːrbər/ (n. 港口) hoards ships, but from **lifting** /ˈlɪftɪŋ/ (v. 举起) others up."

The verdict came: the owner was found guilty. Workers would receive **compensation** /ˌkɑːmpenˈseɪʃn/ (n. 补偿), and **new** /nuː/ (adj. 新的) standards would be **enforced** /ɪnˈfɔːrst/ (v. 执行). **Given** /ˈɡɪvn/ (prep. 考虑到) the **circumstances** /ˈsɜːrkəmstænsɪz/ (n. 情况), it was an **impressive** victory. That evening, Sarah stood with the workers, holding cups of **cream** /kriːm/ (n. 奶油)-colored **tea** /tiː/ (n. 茶). The **dough** /doʊ/ (n. 生面团；钱) they'd earn now would be **honest** /ˈɑːnɪst/ (adj. 诚实的). As they celebrated, Sarah **treasured** /ˈtreʒərd/ (v. 珍视) this moment—not for personal **credit**, but for what it meant: a step toward true **equality**.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

莎拉·金博士建立了令人印象深刻的职业生涯，为正义而战。作为一名活动家，她致力于揭露滥用系统并要求平等。她的办公室展示着一个标语："在一个充满噪音的世界里，为无声者发声。"人们称她为他们挚爱的捍卫者，尽管她坚持说："亲爱的，我只是在做正确的事。"

一个关于工厂的案件引起了她的注意。工人们描述了可怕的条件——没有休息，工资低，以及对任何抱怨者的威胁。工厂主是一个将工人视为工具的人，他创建了一个建立在权力滥用之上的系统。莎拉知道这不仅仅是法律问题，而是关于人的尊严。

她会见了分享故事的工人。一位女士握着女儿给她带来好运的小硬币，轻声说道："他对待我们就像我们什么都不是。当有人试图说话时，他用冒犯性的话骂他们并进行威胁。"莎拉感到愤怒上涌，但保持了中立的声音。"你们的勇气令人印象深刻，"她说。"我们一起会让这件事正确。"

莎拉开始建立她的案件。她通过所有可用的媒介收集证据——照片、录音、证词。这种情况令来自各个组织的代表担忧。一位律师提出仅为荣誉而工作，说："他所做的不仅仅是剥削——暴力威胁让情况更糟。这些不是空话。"

审判将一切暴露于光下。工厂主的信条很简单：利润高于人。但莎拉提出的证据如此纯粹和清晰，以至于否认是不可能的。她谈到了人的尊严的财富，谈到了既重视生产力又重视人的创新解决方案。"真正的满足不是像港口囤积船只一样囤积，而是提升他人。"

判决结果：工厂主被判有罪。工人们将获得补偿，新标准将被执行。考虑到这种情况，这是一个令人印象深刻的胜利。那天晚上，莎拉与工人们站在一起，手持奶油色的茶杯。他们现在赚到的钱将是诚实的。在他们庆祝时，莎拉珍视这一刻——不是为了个人荣誉，而是为了它的意义：迈向真正平等的一步。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子1
**原句：** "In a world full of noise, be a voice for the voiceless."

**分析：** 这是一个祈使句格式的座右铭。"full of noise"与"voice for the voiceless"形成音韵和意义上的对比。"voiceless"是形容词用作名词（the + adj.表示一类人）。

**亮点：** 
- 头韵："voice" 和 "voiceless"的重复创造节奏美
- 对比："noise"（噪音）vs. "voice"（声音），暗示要发出有意义的声音，而非空洞的噪音
- 简洁有力的行动号召，体现了activist的使命

---

### 句子2
**原句：** "Given the circumstances, it was an impressive victory."

**分析：** "Given"在这里是介词，意为"考虑到"。这种用法将"give"的过去分词词化为介词，引导条件或背景信息。

**亮点：** 
- "Given"比"considering"稍微正式，常用于书面语
- 强调在困难条件下取得的成就更有价值
- 简洁地引入背景，避免了冗长的从句

---

### 句子3
**原句：** "True satisfaction comes not from hoarding like a harbor hoards ships, but from lifting others up."

**分析：** 使用"not from...but from..."对比结构。"like a harbor hoards ships"是创造性的比喻，"hoarding"和"harbor"的头韵增强表达力。

**亮点：** 
- 比喻新颖：将自私比作港口囤积船只——看似合理但实际上违背了港口的真正功能（让船只流动）
- "lifting others up"与"hoarding"形成价值观对比
- 头韵"harbor hoards"增强记忆性和节奏感

---

### 句子4
**原句：** "Sarah treasured this moment—not for personal credit, but for what it meant: a step toward true equality."

**分析：** 破折号引出对"treasure"的解释，"not for...but for..."再次使用对比结构。冒号后的同位语进一步解释"what it meant"。

**亮点：** 
- 三层结构：treasured → why (not for...but for...) → what it meant (a step...)
- 突出Sarah的无私：不为个人荣誉，而为更大的意义
- "a step toward"暗示这是长期斗争中的一步，现实而不夸大

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦1：Given作为介词的用法

**原句：** "Given the circumstances, it was an impressive victory."

**聚焦：** Given从过去分词演变为介词的用法

**用法说明：**
"Given"作为介词时，意思是"考虑到"、"鉴于"，用于引入需要考虑的背景信息或条件。

**结构：**
- **Given + 名词/名词短语**
  - Given the weather, we'll stay inside.
  - Given her experience, she's the best candidate.

- **Given + that从句**
  - Given that it's raining, we should postpone the picnic.

**与其他表达的对比：**
| 表达 | 正式程度 | 使用场合 |
|------|----------|----------|
| Given | 较正式 | 书面语、学术写作 |
| Considering | 中等 | 通用 |
| In view of | 正式 | 正式场合、官方文件 |
| Because of | 非正式 | 口语、简单因果 |

**注意：**
"Given"强调的是"考虑到某个已知因素"，而不是简单的因果关系。

---

### 聚焦2：As的多重身份

**原句1：** "As an activist, she worked to expose systems of abuse."
**原句2：** "He treats us like we're nothing."

**聚焦：** As vs. Like的用法区分

**用法对比：**

**As = 作为（真实身份/职能）**
- She works **as** a doctor. (她真的是医生)
- **As** your friend, I must tell you the truth. (我真的是你的朋友)
- **As** a child, he lived in Paris. (他那时真的是孩子)

**Like = 像...一样（比喻/相似）**
- She works **like** a doctor. (她不是医生，但工作方式像医生)
- He treated me **like** a fool. (我不是傻瓜，但他那样对待我)
- She sings **like** an angel. (她不是天使，唱得像天使)

**常见错误：**
❌ "Like a teacher, I believe education is important."
✅ "**As** a teacher, I believe education is important."

❌ "She is as beautiful like a flower."
✅ "She is beautiful **like** a flower." 或 "She is **as** beautiful **as** a flower."

**记忆技巧：**
- **As** = identity (身份)
- **Like** = similarity (相似)

She would offer her help concerning any problem—from abuse situations to simple needs for rest and shelter. People gave her much credit for her innovative approaches to solving conflicts.
