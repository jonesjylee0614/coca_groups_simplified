**#SliceOfLife** – A story of healing and balance

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Dr. Emma Walsh stood at the edge of the **cliff** /klɪf/ (n. 悬崖), not contemplating anything dark, but simply finding a moment to breathe. As a **teacher** /ˈtiːtʃər/ (n. 教师) and **counselor** /ˈkaʊnsələr/ (n. 顾问;辅导员) at the regional high school, her **schedule** /ˈskedʒuːl/ (n. 时间表;日程) had become **significantly** /sɪɡˈnɪfɪkəntli/ (adv. 显著地;相当大地) overwhelming **lately** /ˈleɪtli/ (adv. 最近;近来).

Her **research** /rɪˈsɜːrtʃ/ (n./v. 研究;调查) into **genetic** /dʒəˈnetɪk/ (adj. 遗传的;基因的) factors affecting learning had taken a back seat to daily crises. **Available** /əˈveɪləbl/ (adj. 可用的;有空的) time for **yourself** /jɔːrˈself/ (pron. 你自己) seemed to be a luxury she could no longer afford. The constant pressure had begun to **threaten** /ˈθretn/ (v. 威胁;恐吓) her health—both physical and mental.

"You need to stop," her colleague David had said that morning, stubbing out a **cigarette** /ˌsɪɡəˈret/ (n. 香烟). "You're a **model** /ˈmɑːdl/ (n. 模型;榜样; v. 做模特) **teacher**, but even you have limits." Emma had simply nodded, too tired to argue. The **technological** /ˌteknəˈlɑːdʒɪkl/ (adj. 技术的;科技的) tools meant to help—**emails** /ˈiːmeɪlz/ (n. 电子邮件) and apps—had instead become chains.

Standing there now, watching waves crash below, Emma thought about her student, Jake. The boy had sent her an **email** last night, his words desperate. His family situation had taken a turn: his mother had been diagnosed with cancer, and he'd witnessed doctors examine a **shark** /ʃɑːrk/ (n. 鲨鱼)-bite victim at the beach—an experience that **indicated** /ˈɪndɪkeɪtɪd/ (v. 表明;指示) to him just how fragile life was. He'd started smoking **cigarettes** to cope, and his grades showed a **reduction** /rɪˈdʌkʃn/ (n. 减少;降低) in effort.

Emma's own struggles felt small by comparison. She had let stress **overlook** /ˌoʊvərˈlʊk/ (v. 忽视;俯瞰) what truly mattered. She realized she needed to **relieve** /rɪˈliːv/ (v. 减轻;解除) her own burden before she could help others. Perhaps it was time to **sleep** /sliːp/ (v./n. 睡觉;睡眠) more than four hours a night.

Walking back to town, Emma stopped at the school's **orientation** /ˌɔːriənˈteɪʃn/ (n. 方向;定向;迎新) building. Inside, she found Jake sitting alone, his **chin** /tʃɪn/ (n. 下巴) resting on his hand, looking **weak** /wiːk/ (adj. 虚弱的;薄弱的). "Jake," she said softly, "I got your **email**."

The boy looked up, eyes red. "I'm sorry to bother you. I know you're busy."

Emma sat beside him. "We're going to work through this together. But first, I need to tell you something. I've been pushing myself too hard, and **lately** I've realized it's not sustainable. We both need to learn to take better care of ourselves. That's not weakness—it's **wisdom** /ˈwɪzdəm/ (n. 智慧)."

She explained her plan: a **schedule** that included **self-care** /ˈselfˌker/ (n. 自我照顾) time, and connecting Jake with proper **counseling** /ˈkaʊnsəlɪŋ/ (n. 咨询;辅导). "The **research** shows that when we **overlook** our own needs, we can't help others effectively. There's been a **significant** **reduction** in burnout among **teachers** who prioritize **sleep** and boundaries."

Jake managed a small smile. "So you're saying even **teachers** need to be **available** to themselves first?"

"Exactly," Emma said. "Think of it like this: you can't **model** healthy behavior if you're running on empty. And those **cigarettes**? They're not **relieving** anything—they're just adding another problem. Let's work on **better** /ˈbetər/ (adj. 更好的) strategies together."

Over the following weeks, Emma made changes. She set clear boundaries on **email** responses, restructured her **schedule** to include exercise and proper **sleep**, and delegated some **research** tasks. She became a living **model** of the balance she preached. Jake, watching her transformation, found his own strength to seek help and quit smoking.

One evening, Emma returned to the **cliff**, but this time with a sense of peace. The view hadn't changed, but her perspective had. She'd learned that to **truly** /ˈtruːli/ (adv. 真正地) help others, you must first **relieve** your own suffering. As the sun set, she felt grateful—not **weak**, but **stronger** /ˈstrɔːŋɡər/ (adj. 更强壮的) for acknowledging her limits.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

艾玛·沃尔什医生站在悬崖边,并不是在思考什么黑暗的事情,只是想找个时间呼吸一下。作为地区高中的教师和辅导员,她的日程最近变得相当紧张难以承受。

她对影响学习的遗传因素的研究已经让位于日常危机。为自己留出时间似乎成了她再也负担不起的奢侈品。持续的压力已经开始威胁她的健康——无论是身体还是精神上。

"你需要停下来,"她的同事大卫那天早上说,掐灭了一支香烟。"你是个模范教师,但即使你也有极限。"艾玛只是点点头,太累了不想争论。那些本应帮助她的技术工具——电子邮件和应用程序——反而成了枷锁。

此刻站在那里,看着下面的海浪拍打,艾玛想起了她的学生杰克。这个男孩昨晚给她发了一封电子邮件,他的话语充满绝望。他的家庭状况发生了变化:他母亲被诊断出癌症,而且他在海滩上目睹了医生检查鲨鱼咬伤的受害者——这个经历向他表明生命是多么脆弱。他开始吸烟来应对,他的成绩显示出努力程度的降低。

相比之下,艾玛自己的挣扎显得微不足道。她让压力忽视了真正重要的事情。她意识到她需要先减轻自己的负担,然后才能帮助别人。也许是时候每晚睡眠超过四个小时了。

走回城里时,艾玛停在学校的迎新大楼。在里面,她发现杰克独自坐着,下巴靠在手上,看起来很虚弱。"杰克,"她轻声说,"我收到了你的电子邮件。"

男孩抬起头,眼睛发红。"抱歉打扰你。我知道你很忙。"

艾玛坐在他旁边。"我们会一起解决这个问题。但首先,我需要告诉你一些事。我一直过度逼迫自己,最近我意识到这是不可持续的。我们都需要学会更好地照顾自己。这不是软弱——这是智慧。"

她解释了她的计划:一个包括自我照顾时间的日程,并让杰克接受适当的咨询。"研究表明,当我们忽视自己的需求时,我们无法有效地帮助他人。那些优先考虑睡眠和界限的教师,他们的职业倦怠显著减少了。"

杰克露出了一个小小的微笑。"所以你是说即使是教师也需要首先对自己有空?"

"没错,"艾玛说。"这样想:如果你精疲力竭,你就无法树立健康行为的榜样。而那些香烟?它们没有减轻任何东西——它们只是增加了另一个问题。让我们一起制定更好的策略。"

在接下来的几周里,艾玛做出了改变。她为电子邮件回复设定了明确的界限,重组了她的日程以包括锻炼和适当的睡眠,并委派了一些研究任务。她成为了她所宣扬的平衡的活样板。杰克看着她的转变,找到了自己寻求帮助和戒烟的力量。

一天晚上,艾玛回到悬崖,但这次带着平静的心情。景色没有改变,但她的视角变了。她学会了要真正帮助别人,你必须先减轻自己的痛苦。当太阳落山时,她感到感激——不是软弱,而是因为承认了自己的局限而变得更强。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Available time for yourself seemed to be a luxury she could no longer afford."

**分析:** "seem to be" 表示"似乎是"。"a luxury (that) she could no longer afford" 中省略了关系代词 that。"can afford" 在这里是隐喻,不仅指经济上的负担,更指时间和精力上的负担。

**亮点:** 通过"luxury"和"afford"的隐喻用法,生动表达了时间稀缺的困境。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "The research shows that when we overlook our own needs, we can't help others effectively."

**分析:** "research shows that..." 是常用的引用研究结果的句式。"when" 引导时间状语从句,说明条件。主句使用"can't"强调无法做到的后果。

**亮点:** 用科学研究作为论据,增强说服力,是说明道理时的有效方法。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Think of it like this: you can't model healthy behavior if you're running on empty."

**分析:** "Think of it like this:" 是引入解释或类比的常用表达。"run on empty" 是习语,比喻能量耗尽但仍在勉强运转,如同汽车油箱空了还在开。

**亮点:** 使用生活化的习语使抽象道理具体化,易于理解和记忆。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "She'd learned that to truly help others, you must first relieve your own suffering."

**分析:** 不定式 "to truly help" 作宾语从句的主语。"must" 表示必要性。这是一个总结性的哲理句,概括了故事的主题。

**亮点:** 简洁有力地总结了"自助才能助人"的核心道理,适合作为文章结论。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 关系代词的省略

**原句:** "Available time for yourself seemed to be a luxury she could no longer afford."

**聚焦:** 省略关系代词 "that" 或 "which"

**用法说明:** 
当关系代词在定语从句中作宾语时,可以省略。这里完整形式是 "a luxury that/which she could no longer afford",但口语和书面语中常省略,使表达更简洁自然。

**结构分析:**
- 主句: Available time for yourself seemed to be a luxury
- 定语从句: (that) she could no longer afford

**对比:**
- 省略关系代词: "the book I read" (更口语化、简洁)
- 保留关系代词: "the book that I read" (更正式、清晰)

**注意:** 关系代词作主语时不能省略,如 "the woman who called" 中的 who 不能省。

---

### 聚焦点 2: "run on empty" 习语的使用

**原句:** "You can't model healthy behavior if you're running on empty."

**聚焦:** 习语 "run on empty" 的比喻用法

**用法说明:**
"run on empty" 字面意思是"在空油箱的情况下行驶",引申为"在精力耗尽的情况下继续运转"。这个习语生动地描述了过度劳累、缺乏能量补充的状态。

**类似习语:**
- "burn out" (精疲力竭)
- "at the end of one's rope" (山穷水尽)
- "spread oneself too thin" (分身乏术)

**可替换句:** "You can't model healthy behavior if you're exhausted and have no energy left." (更直接但不如习语生动)
