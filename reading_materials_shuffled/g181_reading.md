---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

On a quiet **Monday** /ˈmʌndeɪ/ (n. 星期一) morning, **Grandma** /ˈɡrænmɑː/ (n. 奶奶) Rose stood at the **landing** /ˈlændɪŋ/ (n. 楼梯平台) of her old house, looking down at the **cop** /kɑːp/ (n. 警察) who had come to **see** /siː/ (v. 看见) her. **The** /ðə/ (art. 这个) officer was young, **kind** /kaɪnd/ (adj. 善良的) in manner, and his voice carried a gentle tone when he spoke. "**Ma'am** /mæm/ (n. 女士), we received a call from a **caller** /ˈkɔːlər/ (n. 来电者) who reported some **alleged** /əˈledʒd/ (adj. 所谓的) trouble at your address."

Rose invited him in, **absolutely** /ˈæbsəluːtli/ (adv. 绝对地) confused. She would **neither** /ˈniːðər/ (det. 两者都不) lie nor hide anything. Her home was simple, filled with books about **biology** /baɪˈɑːlədʒi/ (n. 生物学) and old family photos. She explained that she lived alone since her husband, a former **vessel** /ˈvesl/ (n. 船只) captain, had passed away. She spent her days doing **maintenance** /ˈmeɪntənəns/ (n. 维护) on the house, reading, and waiting for her grandson's calls.

The officer's **pursuit** /pərˈsuːt/ (n. 追求；追捕) of the truth was patient. He asked if she would **allow** /əˈlaʊ/ (v. 允许) him to **look** /lʊk/ (v. 看；寻找) around. Rose agreed without hesitation. She had **considerable** /kənˈsɪdərəbl/ (adj. 相当大的) trust in people, a **virtue** /ˈvɜːrtʃuː/ (n. 美德) her late husband had always admired. "**Hopefully** /ˈhoʊpfəli/ (adv. 希望地), you'll find nothing wrong," she said with a soft smile.

After checking the house thoroughly, the officer returned to the living room. He explained that a neighbor, concerned about the **season** /ˈsiːzn/ (n. 季节；时期) of cold weather, had wanted to make sure Rose was okay. The neighbor had noticed she hadn't been outside much and worried about her **willingness** /ˈwɪlɪŋnəs/ (n. 意愿) or ability to **hire** /ˈhaɪər/ (v. 雇用) help if needed.

Rose laughed warmly. "Please tell them I'm fine. I may be old, but I'm still capable." She offered the officer some tea. As he was leaving, he mentioned he was **Korean** /kəˈriːən/ (adj. 韩国的) and his grandmother had been just like her—independent and strong. Rose felt a connection. "**See** /siː/ (v. 明白)," she said, "we're not so different, you and I." That small visit reminded her that **the** world still had people who cared, people who showed up just to make sure an old woman was safe.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

在一个安静的星期一早晨,罗斯奶奶站在她老房子的楼梯平台上,低头看着来看她的警察。这个年轻的警官举止善良,说话时声音温和。"女士,我们接到一个来电者的电话,报告说您的地址有一些所谓的麻烦。"

罗斯请他进来,感到绝对困惑。她既不会撒谎也不会隐瞒任何事。她的家很简单,摆满了生物学书籍和老家庭照片。她解释说,自从她的丈夫——一位前船长去世后,她就独自生活。她每天做房屋维护、阅读,等待孙子的电话。

警官对真相的追寻很有耐心。他问她是否允许他四处看看。罗斯毫不犹豫地同意了。她对人有相当大的信任,这是她已故丈夫一直钦佩的美德。"希望你不会发现任何问题,"她温柔地微笑着说。

在彻底检查房子后,警官回到客厅。他解释说,一位邻居担心寒冷天气的季节,想确保罗斯没事。邻居注意到她最近不太出门,担心她是否有意愿或能力在需要时雇用帮手。

罗斯温暖地笑了。"请告诉他们我很好。我可能老了,但还是很能干的。"她给警官倒了些茶。当他离开时,他提到自己是韩国人,他的奶奶就像她一样——独立而坚强。罗斯感到一种联系。"明白了,"她说,"你和我并没有那么不同。"这次小小的拜访提醒她,这个世界上仍然有关心他人的人,有人会出现只是为了确保一位老妇人安全。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The officer was young, kind in manner, and his voice carried a gentle tone when he spoke."

**分析:** 这句使用了并列结构,描述警官的三个特征:年轻、举止和善、声音温和。"kind in manner"是"形容词+介词短语"结构,比单独使用"kind"更具体。"carried a gentle tone"用拟人化手法,让抽象的声音特质具象化。

**亮点:** 通过多角度描写(年龄、举止、声音),快速建立人物形象,让读者对角色产生好感。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "She would neither lie nor hide anything."

**分析:** 使用了"neither...nor..."并列否定结构,强调罗斯的诚实品格。这种双重否定比单纯说"She was honest"更有力度。"would"在这里表示习惯性行为或性格特征。

**亮点:** "neither...nor"结构在正式英语中常用,表达更加优雅和强调。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "She had considerable trust in people, a virtue her late husband had always admired."

**分析:** 主句后接同位语"a virtue...",进一步解释"trust"。定语从句"her late husband had always admired"修饰"virtue",增加了情感深度,暗示这种信任是有历史渊源的品质。

**亮点:** 通过同位语和定语从句,将现在的品格与过去的回忆连接,丰富了叙事层次。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "That small visit reminded her that the world still had people who cared, people who showed up just to make sure an old woman was safe."

**分析:** 主句后接宾语从句"that the world still had...",从句内又有定语从句"who cared"。第二个"people"是前面"people"的同位语,后接另一个定语从句"who showed up...",形成递进强调。

**亮点:** 通过重复"people"和两个定语从句,层层递进地强化主题,结尾温暖而有力。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "neither...nor..."并列否定结构

**原句:** "She would neither lie nor hide anything."

**聚焦:** 并列否定连词的使用

**用法说明:** 
"neither...nor..."用于连接两个否定的并列成分,表示"既不...也不..."。注意这是完全否定,不需要在动词前再加"not"。在正式写作和演讲中,这种结构比使用两个单独的否定句更优雅、更有力。

**结构要点:**
- neither A nor B (两者都不)
- 当连接主语时,谓语动词通常与靠近的主语保持一致
- 比"not...or..."更正式

**可替换句:** "She would not lie or hide anything." (意思相同,但不如原句正式和强调)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 同位语的使用

**原句:** "She had considerable trust in people, a virtue her late husband had always admired."

**聚焦:** 同位语结构补充说明

**用法说明:**
同位语"a virtue..."用来重新表述或解释前面的"trust in people"。这种结构让句子信息更丰富,同时保持流畅性。定语从句"her late husband had always admired"进一步修饰"virtue",增加了情感色彩和背景信息。

**结构分析:**
- 主要信息: She had considerable trust in people
- 同位语: a virtue (解释trust是一种美德)
- 定语从句: her late husband had always admired (说明这个美德的重要性)

**可替换句:** "She had considerable trust in people. This virtue was something her late husband had always admired." (分成两句,但失去了原句的紧凑感和文学性)
