## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **old** /oʊld/ (adj. 老的;旧的) **Roman** /ˈroʊmən/ (adj./n. 罗马的;罗马人) **bridge** /brɪdʒ/ (n. 桥) stood at the edge of the village, **empty** /ˈempti/ (adj. 空的) of travelers but full of history. Elena had walked across it countless times, but today felt different. She had just received the **mail** /meɪl/ (n./v. 邮件;邮寄)—a letter saying she had **succeed** /səkˈsiːd/ (v. 成功) in her **inquiry** /ɪnˈkwaɪri/ (n. 询问;调查) to study the **heritage** /ˈherɪtɪdʒ/ (n. 遗产;传统) of her homeland.

The **bridge** /brɪdʒ/ (n. 桥) had been built centuries ago, when the **province** /ˈprɑːvɪns/ (n. 省;领域) was part of a great empire. Stories spoke of a **battle** /ˈbætl/ (n./v. 战斗) fought near its stones, where warriors had shown **outstanding** /aʊtˈstændɪŋ/ (adj. 杰出的) courage. But these were just stories, passed down like **old** /oʊld/ (adj. 古老的) songs. Elena wanted proof, something to **bind** /baɪnd/ (v. 绑定;约束) the past to the present.

Her grandfather had **born** /bɔːrn/ (v. 出生) in this village seventy years ago. Before he died, he told Elena about a **script** /skrɪpt/ (n. 剧本;手稿) hidden somewhere near the **bridge** /brɪdʒ/ (n. 桥)—a document **worth** /wɜːrθ/ (adj./n. 值得的;价值) more than gold, he said. It contained the true history of their people, written by a **Roman** /ˈroʊmən/ (adj. 罗马的) scholar who had lived through those times.

"**Yes** /jes/ (adv. 是的)," her grandmother would say, "but finding it is like fighting a **demon** /ˈdiːmən/ (n. 恶魔;魔鬼). The **bridge** /brɪdʒ/ (n. 桥) keeps its secrets." The **old** /oʊld/ (adj. 年迈的) woman's words carried both **fear** /fɪr/ (n./v. 恐惧) and respect for the **heritage** /ˈherɪtɪdʒ/ (n. 遗产) they guarded.

Elena's **desire** /dɪˈzaɪr/ (n./v. 渴望) to find the **script** /skrɪpt/ (n. 手稿) wasn't just academic. She wanted to **earn** /ɜːrn/ (v. 赚得;获得) knowledge that could **inspire** /ɪnˈspaɪr/ (v. 激励;鼓舞) future generations. The **province** /ˈprɑːvɪns/ (n. 省) was changing rapidly, **old** /oʊld/ (adj. 旧的) buildings replaced by new ones. Soon, nothing would remain to show what had been.

Her research had given her one **indication** /ˌɪndɪˈkeɪʃn/ (n. 指示;迹象) of where to look: beneath the **bridge** /brɪdʒ/ (n. 桥), where stones met water. There was an **empty** /ˈempti/ (adj. 空的) space, a hollow that might once have served as storage. The **aim** /eɪm/ (n./v. 目标;瞄准) was clear—she would search there at dawn, when the river was low.

That night, Elena could barely sleep. She thought about the **battle** /ˈbætl/ (n. 战斗) her grandfather described, about soldiers who would **mail** /meɪl/ (v. 邮寄) letters home, wondering if they would **succeed** /səkˈsiːd/ (v. 成功) in returning. She thought about the **Roman** /ˈroʊmən/ (adj. 罗马的) engineers who had built the **bridge** /brɪdʒ/ (n. 桥) to last forever, creating something **worth** /wɜːrθ/ (adj. 值得的) remembering.

At first light, Elena climbed down to the river's edge. The **empty** /ˈempti/ (adj. 空荡荡的) space was there, just as the **old** /oʊld/ (adj. 古老的) maps suggested. She reached inside, her hands shaking. Was this foolish? Would she find nothing but **empty** /ˈempti/ (adj. 空的) darkness?

Then her fingers touched something—a metal box, sealed against time. Inside was the **script** /skrɪpt/ (n. 手稿), wrapped in cloth. The pages were fragile, **born** /bɔːrn/ (v. 承载) from centuries past. Elena's heart raced. This was real. The **heritage** /ˈherɪtɪdʒ/ (n. 遗产) wasn't lost after all.

The **script** /skrɪpt/ (n. 手稿) told of the **battle** /ˈbætl/ (n. 战斗), **yes** /jes/ (adv. 是的), but also of everyday life—how people **earn** /ɜːrn/ (v. 谋生) their living, what they **fear** /fɪr/ (v. 害怕), what gave them hope. One passage **inspire** /ɪnˈspaɪr/ (v. 激励) her deeply: "We **bind** /baɪnd/ (v. 装订) these words so future children will know their **aim** /eɪm/ (n. 目标)—not to forget, but to build upon what we leave."

Elena sat by the **bridge** /brɪdʒ/ (n. 桥), reading carefully. The **outstanding** /aʊtˈstændɪŋ/ (adj. 卓越的) courage of past generations wasn't in grand battles alone, but in preserving **info** /ˈɪnfoʊ/ (n. 信息) for those who would come after. The **indication** /ˌɪndɪˈkeɪʃn/ (n. 迹象) was clear: **heritage** /ˈherɪtɪdʒ/ (n. 传统) was a **bridge** /brɪdʒ/ (n. 桥梁) connecting past and future.

She would **mail** /meɪl/ (v. 邮寄) copies to universities, share her **inquiry** /ɪnˈkwaɪri/ (n. 调查) with scholars. But first, she would tell her village. They needed to see that their **province** /ˈprɑːvɪns/ (n. 省) had a story **worth** /wɜːrθ/ (adj. 值得的) protecting, that the **old** /oʊld/ (adj. 古老的) ways held **desire** /dɪˈzaɪr/ (n. 愿望) and **aim** /eɪm/ (n. 目的) that still mattered.

The **disease** /dɪˈziːz/ (n. 疾病) of forgetting was worse than any **demon** /ˈdiːmən/ (n. 恶魔), her grandfather had said. Now Elena understood. The **Roman** /ˈroʊmən/ (adj. 罗马的) **bridge** /brɪdʒ/ (n. 桥) wasn't just stone—it was a promise that **heritage** /ˈherɪtɪdʒ/ (n. 遗产) could **succeed** /səkˈsiːd/ (v. 成功) in surviving, if someone cared enough to look. The **old** /oʊld/ (adj. 古老的) **script** /skrɪpt/ (n. 手稿) had been **born** /bɔːrn/ (v. 产生) from **fear** /fɪr/ (n. 恐惧) of loss, but now it would **inspire** /ɪnˈspaɪr/ (v. 激励) hope. And that, Elena thought, was **worth** /wɜːrθ/ (adj. 值得的) everything.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

那座古老的罗马桥矗立在村庄边缘,虽然空无行人,却满载历史。埃琳娜曾无数次走过它,但今天感觉不同。她刚收到邮件——一封信说她成功通过了研究祖国遗产的申请。

这座桥建于几个世纪前,当时这个省是一个伟大帝国的一部分。故事讲述了在桥边石头附近进行的一场战斗,战士们展现了杰出的勇气。但这些只是故事,像古老的歌曲一样流传下来。埃琳娜想要证据,一些能把过去与现在联系起来的东西。

她的祖父七十年前出生在这个村庄。在他去世前,他告诉埃琳娜关于一份藏在桥附近某处的手稿——一份比黄金更有价值的文献,他说。它包含了他们人民的真实历史,由一位亲历那些时代的罗马学者撰写。

"是的,"她的祖母会说,"但找到它就像与恶魔战斗。这座桥保守着它的秘密。"老妇人的话语对他们守护的遗产既怀有恐惧又充满尊重。

埃琳娜寻找手稿的渴望不仅仅是学术性的。她想获得能激励未来几代人的知识。这个省正在迅速变化,旧建筑被新建筑取代。很快,将没有任何东西留下来展示曾经的样子。

她的研究给了她一个寻找的指示:在桥下,石头与水相接的地方。那里有一个空间,一个可能曾用作储藏的空洞。目标很明确——她会在黎明时在那里搜索,那时河水较低。

那天晚上,埃琳娜几乎无法入睡。她想着祖父描述的战斗,想着会邮寄信件回家的士兵,不知道他们是否能成功返回。她想着建造这座桥以求永恒的罗马工程师,创造了一些值得记住的东西。

天刚亮,埃琳娜爬到河边。那个空间就在那里,正如古老地图所示。她伸手进去,双手颤抖。这很愚蠢吗?她会不会只找到空荡荡的黑暗?

然后她的手指触到了什么——一个金属盒,密封抵抗时间。里面是手稿,用布包裹着。页面很脆弱,承载着几个世纪的过去。埃琳娜的心跳加速。这是真的。遗产毕竟没有丢失。

手稿讲述了战斗,是的,但也讲述了日常生活——人们如何谋生,他们害怕什么,什么给了他们希望。一段话深深激励了她:"我们装订这些文字,让未来的孩子知道他们的目标——不是忘记,而是在我们留下的基础上建设。"

埃琳娜坐在桥边,仔细阅读。过去几代人的卓越勇气不仅在于宏大的战斗,而在于为后来者保存信息。迹象很清楚:遗产是连接过去和未来的桥梁。

她会把副本邮寄给大学,与学者分享她的调查。但首先,她会告诉她的村庄。他们需要看到他们的省有一个值得保护的故事,古老的方式仍然怀有愿望和目标。

遗忘的疾病比任何恶魔都糟糕,她的祖父曾说过。现在埃琳娜明白了。罗马桥不仅仅是石头——它是一个承诺,如果有人足够关心去寻找,遗产就能成功存续。古老的手稿诞生于对失去的恐惧,但现在它会激励希望。埃琳娜想,这值得一切。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The bridge had been built centuries ago, when the province was part of a great empire."

**分析:** 主句使用过去完成时 "had been built",表示在故事开始之前很久就完成的动作。"centuries ago" 强调时间的久远。"when" 引导时间状语从句,进一步说明建桥的历史背景。

**亮点:** 通过时态和时间状语从句的配合,在一个句子中浓缩了大量历史信息,展现了叙事的深度。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Elena's desire to find the script wasn't just academic."

**分析:** "desire to find" 是"名词 + 不定式"结构,不定式作后置定语修饰 "desire"。"wasn't just academic" 使用否定 + "just" 的结构,暗示还有更深层的动机。

**亮点:** 通过 "not just" 结构,为后文揭示主人公更深层的动机埋下伏笔,增加叙事张力。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Was this foolish? Would she find nothing but empty darkness?"

**分析:** 两个疑问句连续使用,展现主人公内心的犹豫和恐惧。"nothing but" 是固定搭配,意为"只不过、仅仅"。这种自问的方式是内心独白的常用技巧。

**亮点:** 通过连续的反问,让读者直接感受到主人公的心理状态,增强情感共鸣。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Heritage was a bridge connecting past and future."

**分析:** 这是一个隐喻句,将抽象的 "heritage"(遗产)比作 "bridge"(桥),现在分词 "connecting" 作后置定语修饰 "bridge"。这个隐喻呼应了故事的核心意象——罗马桥。

**亮点:** 通过将故事的核心意象(桥)与主题(遗产)巧妙结合,升华了故事的寓意,是高级写作技巧。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 过去完成时的被动语态

**原句:** "The bridge had been built centuries ago, when the province was part of a great empire."

**聚焦:** 过去完成时的被动语态 (had been built)

**用法说明:** 
过去完成时的被动语态由 "had been + 过去分词" 构成,表示在过去某个时间点之前就已经完成的被动动作。这里的"建桥"发生在故事开始(过去)之前的更早时期,所以用过去完成时;桥是"被建造"的,所以用被动语态。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: The bridge
- 谓语: had been built (过去完成时被动语态)
- 时间状语: centuries ago
- 时间状语从句: when the province was part of a great empire

**可替换句:** "The bridge was built centuries ago" (用一般过去时,但失去了"更早的过去"这一时间层次感)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "nothing but" 的用法

**原句:** "Would she find nothing but empty darkness?"

**聚焦:** 固定搭配 "nothing but" (只不过;仅仅)

**用法说明:**
"nothing but" 是固定搭配,意为"只有、仅仅",通常用于否定或表达失望的语境。虽然包含 "nothing",但整体意思并非完全否定,而是"除了...之外什么都没有",等同于 "only"。

**结构分析:**
- Would she find (疑问句)
- nothing but empty darkness (宾语)
  - nothing but: 固定搭配
  - empty darkness: 名词短语

**可替换句:** 
1. "Would she find only empty darkness?" (用 "only" 替换,意思相同但语气较弱)
2. "Would she find anything except empty darkness?" (用 "except" 表达,但不如原句简洁)

---
