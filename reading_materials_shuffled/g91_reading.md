**#TechAndFuture** – A story of infrastructure and responsibility

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

**Today** /təˈdeɪ/ (adv. 今天), Maya Chen stood **before** /bɪˈfɔːr/ (prep. 在...之前) the city council, her hands **over** /ˈoʊvər/ (prep. 在...之上) a thick folder of **information** /ˌɪnfərˈmeɪʃn/ (n. 信息;情报). As an **expert** /ˈekspɜːrt/ (n. 专家; adj. 熟练的) on water **infrastructure** /ˈɪnfrəstrʌktʃər/ (n. 基础设施), she had a **responsibility** /rɪˌspɑːnsəˈbɪləti/ (n. 责任;职责) to speak the truth, even when it felt **bad** /bæd/ (adj. 坏的;糟糕的).

"The **supreme** /suˈpriːm/ (adj. 最高的;至上的) court ruled that clean water is a basic right," Maya began. "Yet our **storage** /ˈstɔːrɪdʒ/ (n. 储存;仓库) tanks are old. **Fewer** /ˈfjuːər/ (adj. 更少的) than half meet current standards." She pointed to a chart showing the **findings** /ˈfaɪndɪŋz/ (n. 调查结果;发现) of her team's research.

The **middle** /ˈmɪdl/ (n./adj. 中间) row of seats held concerned citizens. One man raised his hand, his face **familiar** /fəˈmɪliər/ (adj. 熟悉的;常见的). "Ms. Chen, can you **characterize** /ˈkærəktəraɪz/ (v. 描述...的特征) the risk we face?"

Maya chose her words carefully. "To **spell** /spel/ (v. 拼写;招致) it out simply: if we don't act, we could face a crisis. The city's water system needs at least ten **gallons** /ˈɡælənz/ (n. 加仑) per person per day. Our current **infrastructure** can't guarantee that during emergencies."

The council president, known to be a **liar** /ˈlaɪər/ (n. 说谎者) who downplayed problems, shifted uncomfortably. But Maya pressed on. "We must not **abandon** /əˈbændən/ (v. 放弃;抛弃) this **import**ant /ɪmˈpɔːrt/ (adj. 重要的; n./v. 进口;重要性) issue. Each **house** /haʊs/ (n. 房子) in our city depends on safe water."

"**Honor** /ˈɑːnər/ (n./v. 荣誉;尊敬) your promise to protect public **welfare** /ˈwelfer/ (n. 福利;幸福)," Maya concluded. "The **trigger** /ˈtrɪɡər/ (n./v. 扳机;触发) for action should be evidence, not disaster."

After the meeting, Maya returned to her small office. The space was nothing special—just a desk and shelves packed with documents. But here, she could **wash** /wɑːʃ/ (v. 洗;冲刷) away the day's stress and focus on solutions.

Weeks passed. Finally, the city announced a plan to upgrade the water **infrastructure**. The project would cost millions, but it was necessary. Maya's **findings** had made the difference. She had refused to let anyone **characterize** the situation as anything other than urgent.

On the last day of planning meetings, a young engineer approached her. "Ms. Chen, your work **today** has given us hope. You didn't **abandon** the truth, even when it was difficult."

Maya smiled, thinking about the **responsibility** that came with being an **expert**. Sometimes the most **honor**able thing you can do is refuse to be a **liar** about problems that affect everyone's **welfare**. The **supreme** measure of success isn't popularity—it's making sure **fewer** people suffer **before** it's too late.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

今天,玛雅·陈站在市议会面前,双手放在一个装满信息的厚文件夹上。作为水利基础设施专家,她有责任说出真相,即使感觉很糟糕。

"最高法院裁定清洁用水是基本权利,"玛雅开始说。"然而我们的储存罐很旧。只有不到一半符合现行标准。"她指着一张图表,显示了她团队研究的调查结果。

中间一排座位坐着关心的市民。一个男人举手,他的脸很熟悉。"陈女士,您能描述一下我们面临的风险的特征吗?"

玛雅仔细措辞。"简单地说:如果我们不采取行动,我们可能面临危机。城市的供水系统每人每天至少需要十加仑。我们目前的基础设施在紧急情况下无法保证这一点。"

以淡化问题而闻名的议会主席,一个说谎者,不安地移动着。但玛雅继续说。"我们不能放弃这个重要的问题。我们城市的每个房子都依赖于安全的水。"

"尊重你保护公共福利的承诺,"玛雅总结道。"行动的触发因素应该是证据,而不是灾难。"

会议结束后,玛雅回到她的小办公室。这个空间没什么特别的——只有一张桌子和装满文件的书架。但在这里,她可以洗去一天的压力,专注于解决方案。

几周过去了。最后,市政府宣布了一项升级水利基础设施的计划。这个项目将耗资数百万,但很有必要。玛雅的调查结果产生了影响。她拒绝让任何人把情况描述成不紧急的。

在规划会议的最后一天,一位年轻工程师走近她。"陈女士,您今天的工作给了我们希望。即使困难,您也没有放弃真相。"

玛雅微笑着,想着作为专家伴随而来的责任。有时候最光荣的事情就是拒绝对影响每个人福利的问题撒谎。成功的最高衡量标准不是受欢迎程度——而是确保在为时已晚之前更少的人受苦。
