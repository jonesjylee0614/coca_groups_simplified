**#SliceOfLife** – A story of family mysteries and rediscovery

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The old **wooden** /ˈwʊdn/ (adj. 木制的;呆板的) box sat on the shelf, a **puzzle** /ˈpʌzl/ (n./v. 谜;困惑;使困惑) that had **puzzled** Emma for years. **After** /ˈæftər/ (prep./conj. 在...之后) her grandmother passed away, the **frame** /freɪm/ (n. 框架;画框) house felt empty, but this box remained, locked and mysterious. Emma had always wondered what was inside, but her mother said the key was lost **prior** to Grandma's death. Now, **starting** /ˈstɑːrtɪŋ/ (v./adj. 开始[start的现在分词];起始的) a new chapter in her life, Emma decided it was time to solve this **puzzle**.

She sat at the **gathering** /ˈɡæðərɪŋ/ (n. 聚会;集会) table where her **family** used to eat dinner. The box was **associated** /əˈsoʊʃieɪtɪd/ (adj./v. 有关联的;联系[associate的过去式]) with so many memories. Her grandmother would sometimes touch it with a gentle **gesture** /ˈdʒestʃər/ (n. 姿态;手势), but never opened it in front of anyone. "**Everybody** /ˈevrɪbɑːdi/ (pron. 每个人) has secrets," Grandma used to say with a sad smile. "Some **ought** /ɔːt/ (modal v. 应该;应当) to stay that way."

But Emma couldn't let it go. She examined the lock **closely**. It was old-fashioned, nothing **like** the **modern** locks you see today. She tried **various** tools, careful not to damage the **wooden** surface. As she worked, she felt a strange **panic** /ˈpænɪk/ (n./v. 恐慌;惊慌) rising in her chest. What if the contents were **overwhelming** /ˌoʊvərˈwelmɪŋ/ (adj. 压倒性的;势不可挡的)? What if she **ought** not to open it?

**After** an hour of **trying**, Emma heard a soft click. The lock opened. Inside, she found photographs, letters, and a small notebook. The **recent** /ˈriːsnt/ (adj. 最近的;新近的) dust on the box contrasted with the carefully preserved items inside. Emma's hands shook as she picked up the first photograph. It showed her grandmother as a young woman, standing next to a man Emma didn't recognize. On the back, someone had written: "My **reservation** /ˌrezərˈveɪʃn/ (n. 保留;预订;保留地) about leaving you has never **cleared**. **Forward** /ˈfɔːrwərd/ (adv./adj. 向前;前面的) I must go, but my heart stays with you."

Emma felt her breath catch. This was clearly a love letter. But who was this man? Her grandfather had died **previous** /ˈpriːviəs/ (adj. 以前的;先前的) to Emma's birth, and this photo looked **relatively** /ˈrelətɪvli/ (adv. 相对地;比较而言) old, from **decades** ago. She opened the notebook and began reading. The entries were in her grandmother's handwriting, written **after** she had married Emma's grandfather.

"Today marks another year," one entry read. "I am happy with my **life**, and my husband is good to me. **Yet**, in quiet moments, I think of what might have been. **Commissioner** /kəˈmɪʃənər/ (n. 专员;委员) Chen—that was his title—wanted me to wait, to go **forward** with our plans. But my **family** needed me here. I made a choice, and I must **protect** /prəˈtekt/ (v. 保护) that choice by never looking back."

Emma sat back, trying to process this information. Her grandmother had loved someone else **before** marrying her grandfather? The **puzzle** was becoming **clear**, but it also raised new questions. She **continued** reading, entry **after** entry, each one revealing a **continuing** /kənˈtɪnjuːɪŋ/ (adj. 持续的;继续的) love that her grandmother had carried silently for decades.

The notebook also contained something surprising: **feedback** /ˈfiːdbæk/ (n. 反馈;回应) from Commissioner Chen. Apparently, they had maintained a correspondence, though strictly as friends **after** her marriage. He had become someone her grandmother could talk to about her thoughts and dreams, even as she built a life with someone else. The letters were respectful, never crossing boundaries, but full of mutual understanding.

"I **ought** to **investigate** /ɪnˈvestɪɡeɪt/ (v. 调查;研究) more about this Commissioner Chen," Emma thought. She called her mother. "Mom, did Grandma ever mention someone named Commissioner Chen?"

There was a long pause. "Where did you hear that name?" her mother asked, her voice **tight**.

"I found Grandma's old box. I opened it. There are letters and photos." Emma paused. "Did you know about this?"

Her mother sighed. "**Everybody** in the **family** knew bits and pieces, but we never talked about it **openly**. Your grandmother asked us not to. She said it was her **previous** life, and she had made her peace with it. But yes, Commissioner Chen was a man she loved when she was young. He worked for the government, helping to **ensure** /ɪnˈʃʊr/ (v. 确保;保证) fair treatment of people in rural areas. He was passionate about justice."

"What happened to him?" Emma asked.

"He moved away, **continued** his work in other regions. **After** your grandmother married, they lost touch for years. Then, much **later**, he wrote to her, wanting to reconnect as friends. Your grandfather knew about it and, surprisingly, supported it. He understood that your grandmother's past shaped who she was, and he loved all of her, including her memories."

Emma felt tears in her eyes. This was so different from the simple story she had grown up with. Her grandparents' marriage, which had always seemed straightforward, was actually built on deep understanding and acceptance. "That's beautiful," Emma said.

"It is," her mother agreed. "**Relatively** speaking, it's rare to find such mature love. Your grandfather made a **gesture** of great trust, and your grandmother honored that trust every day of their marriage."

**After** the call, Emma **continued** looking through the box. She found a final letter from Commissioner Chen, written just **previous** to his death. "I want to thank you," it read, "for the **feedback** you gave me over the years—your thoughts on life, on meaning, on what matters. Our friendship, though it came **after** what we both wanted, was still precious. **Ensure** that your **family** knows how much you loved them. **Forward** them my best wishes. And know that our **story**, though not what we planned, was still worth living."

Emma carefully placed everything back in the box. She understood now why her grandmother had kept it locked. It wasn't shame—it was **protection**. These memories were precious but **private**, a part of her life that needed a **frame** around it, a boundary that **cleared** space for both the past and the present.

That **evening**, Emma's **family** had a **gathering**. Emma told them about the box, showing them the photos and reading selected passages. At first, there was **panic**—some relatives worried about what this meant for the **family** **history**. But as Emma explained the full **story**, a different feeling emerged: respect.

"Grandma was more complex than we knew," Emma's uncle said. "This doesn't **diminish** her love for Grandpa. If anything, it shows how strong their **relationship** was. **Everybody** has a past. What matters is what you do **forward** from there."

**Everybody** nodded. They talked late into the night, sharing their own memories of both grandparents. The **wooden** box, which had been a **puzzle**, became a **bridge**—connecting **previous** generations to the **recent** one, helping **everybody** understand that love comes in many forms.

**After** the **gathering**, Emma's mother approached her. "Thank you for opening that box," she said. "I know Grandma said it **ought** to stay closed, but maybe she was wrong. **Relatively** speaking, secrets can **weigh** us down. Sharing this has been **overwhelming**, but in a good way. It **ensures** that her full **story** lives on."

Emma smiled. "**Everybody** deserves to have their full **story** told. Not just the easy parts, but the **puzzles** too. That's what makes us human."

As Emma drove home, she thought about the **continuing** mystery of human hearts. We all carry multiple stories, multiple loves, multiple choices. The **wooden** box had held one chapter of her grandmother's life—but her grandmother's real **legacy** was bigger than that. It was in the **gesture** of love she showed **everybody**, in the way she **protected** her **family** while also honoring her **previous** self, in her **ability** to move **forward** while never **forgetting**.

The **puzzle** was solved, but Emma understood that some **questions** would always remain. And that was okay. Some mysteries **ought** to stay **mysterious**, not because they're shameful, but because they're sacred. The important thing was to approach them with **respect**, to **ensure** that in **investigating** the past, we **protect** the people who lived it.

Emma **glanced** at her own **reflection** in the car mirror. She carried her own **puzzles**, her own **complications**. **Everybody** did. And maybe that was the real lesson from the **wooden** box: we're all more than we appear, and **everybody** deserves **compassion** for the **continuing** **journey** of being human.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

旧木箱放在架子上,这是多年来一直困扰艾玛的谜团。祖母去世后,框架结构的房子感觉空荡荡的,但这个箱子还在,上锁而神秘。艾玛一直想知道里面是什么,但她母亲说钥匙在奶奶去世前就丢了。现在,开始人生新篇章的艾玛决定是时候解决这个谜团了。

她坐在聚会桌旁,那里曾是她家人吃晚饭的地方。这个箱子与许多回忆相关。她的祖母有时会用温柔的手势触摸它,但从不在别人面前打开。"每个人都有秘密,"奶奶常带着悲伤的微笑说。"有些应该保持那样。"

但艾玛无法放手。她仔细检查锁。它是老式的,一点也不像你今天看到的现代锁。她尝试了各种工具,小心不损坏木制表面。在工作时,她感到一种奇怪的恐慌在胸中升起。如果内容是压倒性的怎么办?如果她不应该打开它怎么办?

经过一个小时的尝试,艾玛听到了轻微的咔嗒声。锁打开了。里面,她发现了照片、信件和一个小笔记本。箱子上最近的灰尘与里面精心保存的物品形成对比。艾玛拿起第一张照片时手在颤抖。照片显示她的祖母是一位年轻女士,站在艾玛不认识的男人旁边。背面有人写道:"我对离开你的保留从未消除。我必须向前走,但我的心留在你身边。"

艾玛感到呼吸停滞。这显然是一封情书。但这个男人是谁?她的祖父在艾玛出生前就去世了,这张照片看起来相对较旧,来自几十年前。她打开笔记本开始阅读。条目是她祖母的笔迹,写于她嫁给艾玛祖父之后。

"今天又是一年,"一篇日记写道。"我对我的生活感到满意,我的丈夫对我很好。然而,在安静的时刻,我会想起可能发生的事情。陈专员——那是他的头衔——想让我等待,继续我们的计划。但我的家人需要我在这里。我做出了选择,我必须通过永不回头来保护那个选择。"

艾玛坐下,试图处理这些信息。她祖母在嫁给她祖父之前爱过别人?谜团变得清晰了,但也引发了新的问题。她继续阅读,一篇接一篇,每一篇都揭示了她祖母默默携带了几十年的持续的爱。

笔记本还包含了令人惊讶的东西:来自陈专员的回应。显然,他们保持了通信,尽管在她结婚后严格作为朋友。他成为了她祖母可以谈论她的想法和梦想的人,即使她与别人建立了生活。信件是尊重的,从不越界,但充满相互理解。

"我应该调查更多关于这位陈专员的信息,"艾玛想。她打电话给她母亲。"妈妈,奶奶有没有提到过一个叫陈专员的人?"

有很长时间的停顿。"你在哪里听到那个名字的?"她母亲问,声音紧绷。

"我找到了奶奶的旧箱子。我打开了它。里面有信件和照片。"艾玛停顿了一下。"你知道这件事吗?"

她母亲叹了口气。"家里每个人都知道一些片段,但我们从未公开谈论过。你祖母要求我们不要。她说这是她以前的生活,她已经与之和解了。但是,陈专员是她年轻时爱过的一个男人。他为政府工作,帮助确保农村地区人民的公平待遇。他对正义充满热情。"

"他怎么了?"艾玛问。

"他搬走了,在其他地区继续他的工作。你祖母结婚后,他们失去联系多年。然后,很久以后,他写信给她,想作为朋友重新联系。你祖父知道这件事,令人惊讶的是,他支持它。他理解你祖母的过去塑造了她是谁,他爱她的全部,包括她的记忆。"

艾玛感到眼中有泪水。这与她长大时的简单故事如此不同。她祖父母的婚姻,一直看起来很简单,实际上是建立在深刻的理解和接受之上的。"那很美,"艾玛说。

"是的,"她母亲同意。"相对而言,找到如此成熟的爱很罕见。你祖父做出了极大信任的姿态,你祖母在婚姻的每一天都尊重那种信任。"

电话后,艾玛继续查看箱子。她发现了陈专员的最后一封信,写于他去世前。"我想感谢你,"信中写道,"多年来你给我的反馈——你对生活、意义、重要事物的想法。我们的友谊,虽然来到我们俩想要的之后,仍然是珍贵的。确保你的家人知道你有多爱他们。向他们转达我最好的祝愿。要知道我们的故事,虽然不是我们计划的,仍然值得活着。"

艾玛小心地把所有东西放回箱子。她现在明白为什么她祖母要把它锁起来了。这不是羞耻——而是保护。这些记忆是珍贵但私人的,是她生活中需要一个框架的部分,一个为过去和现在都清理空间的界限。

那天晚上,艾玛的家人有一个聚会。艾玛告诉他们关于箱子的事,向他们展示照片并阅读选定的段落。起初,有恐慌——一些亲戚担心这对家族史意味着什么。但随着艾玛解释完整的故事,出现了不同的感觉:尊重。

"奶奶比我们知道的更复杂,"艾玛的叔叔说。"这并不削弱她对爷爷的爱。如果有的话,它显示了他们的关系有多强大。每个人都有过去。重要的是你从那里向前做什么。"

每个人都点头。他们聊到深夜,分享他们对两位祖父母的回忆。木箱,曾经是个谜团,成了一座桥梁——连接以前的世代和最近的世代,帮助每个人理解爱有许多形式。

聚会后,艾玛的母亲走近她。"谢谢你打开那个箱子,"她说。"我知道奶奶说它应该保持关闭,但也许她错了。相对而言,秘密会压垮我们。分享这个一直是压倒性的,但是是好的方式。它确保她完整的故事得以延续。"

艾玛微笑。"每个人都应该讲述他们完整的故事。不仅是容易的部分,还有谜团。那才是使我们成为人的东西。"

当艾玛开车回家时,她想到了人类心灵的持续之谜。我们都携带多个故事、多个爱、多个选择。木箱保存了她祖母生活的一个章节——但她祖母真正的遗产比那更大。它在于她向每个人展示的爱的姿态,在于她保护家人的同时也尊重以前的自己的方式,在于她向前走却从不忘记的能力。

谜团解决了,但艾玛明白有些问题将永远存在。这没关系。有些谜团应该保持神秘,不是因为它们可耻,而是因为它们是神圣的。重要的是以尊重的态度对待它们,确保在调查过去时,我们保护经历过它的人。

艾玛瞥了一眼车镜里自己的倒影。她携带着自己的谜团,自己的复杂性。每个人都是这样。也许这就是木箱的真正教训:我们都比我们看起来的更多,每个人都应该为作为人类的持续旅程获得同情。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 情态动词 ought to 的用法

**原句:** "Everybody has secrets. Some ought to stay that way."

**聚焦:** ought to 表示应该

**用法说明:** 
"Ought to" 是情态动词,表示"应该、应当",语气比 "should" 稍强,更多地带有道德义务或正确性的含义。它在现代英语中使用频率不如 "should",但在正式场合或表达强烈建议时仍然常用。

**结构:**
- 肯定: ought to + 动词原形
- 否定: ought not to / oughtn't to (较少用)
- 疑问: Ought + 主语 + to...? (较少用)

**与 should 的区别:**
- ought to: 更强调道德义务,更正式
- should: 更常用,语气稍弱

**可替换句:** "Everybody has secrets. Some should stay that way." (语气稍弱)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 过去分词作形容词

**原句:** "She found photographs, letters, and a small notebook. The recent dust on the box contrasted with the carefully preserved items inside."

**聚焦:** "preserved" (被保存的) 作形容词修饰名词

**用法说明:**
许多过去分词可以用作形容词,修饰名词。这些过去分词通常来自及物动词,表示被动意义或完成状态。在本句中,"preserved" 来自动词 "preserve"(保存),作为形容词表示"被精心保存的"。

**常见例子:**
- broken window (被打破的窗户)
- written report (书面报告)
- spoken language (口语)
- frozen food (冷冻食品)

**注意:** 过去分词作形容词时,通常置于名词前,也可在系动词后作表语。
