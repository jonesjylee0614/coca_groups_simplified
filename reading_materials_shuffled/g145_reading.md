**#SliceOfLife** – The Juice Stand Revival

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Elena couldn't **drive** /draɪv/ (v. 开车；驱使) to work **anymore** /ˌeniˈmɔːr/ (adv. 不再；再也). The **door** /dɔːr/ (n. 门) of her old car wouldn't even close **properly** /ˈprɑːpərli/ (adv. 正确地；适当地). She decided to **walk** /wɔːk/ (v. 走路) instead, passing through her **neighborhood** /ˈneɪbərhʊd/ (n. 社区；邻近地区) to reach the small **juice** /dʒuːs/ (n. 果汁) stand she'd inherited from her uncle. The **unit** /ˈjuːnɪt/ (n. 单元；单位) was tiny, barely bigger than a closet, but it was her **asset** /ˈæset/ (n. 资产；财产).

Her uncle had been a **writer** /ˈraɪtər/ (n. 作家) **and** /ænd/ (conj. 和) a dreamer. **Prior** /ˈpraɪər/ (adj./adv. 先前的；在...之前) to his passing, he'd told Elena, "The **objective** /əbˈdʒektɪv/ (n. 目标；adj. 客观的) isn't just to make money. It's to serve your community." She'd **appreciate** /əˈpriːʃieɪt/ (v. 欣赏；感激) those words more each day. The **shore** /ʃɔːr/ (n. 海岸；岸边) nearby drew tourists, but the locals were her true **user** /ˈjuːzər/ (n. 用户；使用者)-s.

Last month, she'd considered whether to **resign** /rɪˈzaɪn/ (v. 辞职；放弃). The **sales** /seɪlz/ (n. 销售) were dropping. Her **formal** /ˈfɔːrml/ (adj. 正式的) education was **in** **marketing** /ˈmɑːrkɪtɪŋ/ (n. 营销；市场营销), but theory doesn't always match reality. She'd almost decided to **fall** /fɔːl/ (v. 落下；跌倒) back on a corporate job. But then a **reminder** /rɪˈmaɪndər/ (n. 提醒；提示) came **in** the form of Mrs. Chen, an elderly woman who'd been coming every morning for twenty years.

"You're not going to **violate** /ˈvaɪəleɪt/ (v. 违反；侵犯) your uncle's trust, are you?" Mrs. Chen asked, her voice gentle but firm. That night, Elena felt **and** understood something deeper. This wasn't about **enterprise** /ˈentərpraɪz/ (n. 企业；事业) success alone—it was about connection.

She started small changes. Better ingredients, a **reward** /rɪˈwɔːrd/ (n./v. 奖励；回报) card for regular customers, and fresh fruit displayed on every **limb** /lɪm/ (n. 肢体；树枝) of the small tree outside. The transformation didn't happen overnight, but slowly, **sales** improved. Elena smiled as she unlocked the **door** each morning. She wouldn't **resign**. This was exactly where she was meant to **be** /biː/ (v. 是；存在).

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

埃琳娜不能再开车去上班了。她旧车的门甚至关不上。她决定改为走路,穿过社区去到她从叔叔那里继承的小果汁摊。这个单元很小,几乎不比壁橱大,但它是她的资产。

她的叔叔曾是一名作家和梦想家。在他去世之前,他告诉埃琳娜:"目标不仅仅是赚钱。而是服务你的社区。"她每天都更加感激这些话。附近的海岸吸引了游客,但当地人才是她真正的用户。

上个月,她曾考虑是否要辞职。销售额在下降。她在市场营销方面受过正规教育,但理论并不总是与现实相符。她几乎决定退回到公司工作。但随后一个提醒以陈太太的形式出现了,她是一位老妇人,二十年来每天早上都来。

"你不会违背你叔叔的信任吧?"陈太太问道,声音温和但坚定。那天晚上,埃琳娜感受到并理解了更深层的东西。这不仅仅是关于企业成功——而是关于联系。

她开始做小改变。更好的原料,给常客的奖励卡,以及在外面小树的每根树枝上展示的新鲜水果。转变不是一夜之间发生的,但慢慢地,销售额提高了。埃琳娜每天早上打开门时都会微笑。她不会辞职了。这正是她应该在的地方。
