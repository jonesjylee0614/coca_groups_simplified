**#SliceOfLife** – A story of courage and compassion

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **coast** /koʊst/ (n. 海岸;海滨) town was quiet in the morning. Sarah sat by the window of the small **shop** /ʃɑːp/ (n. 商店), warming her hands with a bowl of chicken **soup** /suːp/ (n. 汤). She had come here to **paint** /peɪnt/ (v./n. 绘画;油漆) the sea, but found something more important: a reason to stay.

The owner, Mr. Chen, was an **adult** /əˈdʌlt/ (n./adj. 成人;成年的) who had lost his son to **illness** /ˈɪlnəs/ (n. 疾病). The boy had wanted to be a pilot, to take **flight** /flaɪt/ (n. 飞行;航班) across the **whole** /hoʊl/ (adj. 整个的;全部的) world. Mr. Chen kept a **frame** /freɪm/ (n. 框架;相框;v. 给...装框) on the wall with his son's photo. "I'm **sure** /ʃʊr/ (adj. 确信的;一定的) he's watching," he would say.

Sarah wasn't **confident** /ˈkɑːnfɪdənt/ (adj. 自信的;有信心的) about her art. She wanted to **quit** /kwɪt/ (v. 退出;停止) many times. But Mr. Chen encouraged her. "Don't be **silly** /ˈsɪli/ (adj. 愚蠢的;傻的)," he said. "You **have** /hæv/ (v. 有;拥有) talent. You must **engage** /ɪnˈɡeɪdʒ/ (v. 参与;从事;吸引) with the world, **or** /ɔːr/ (conj. 或者;否则) you'll regret it."

One day, a young woman came to the **shop**. Her name was Lisa, and she worked at the **civil** /ˈsɪvl/ (adj. 民用的;公民的) hospital. She looked tired and **emotionally** /ɪˈmoʊʃənəli/ (adv. 情感上;情绪上) drained. "I need help," she said. "We're having a **conference** /ˈkɑːnfərəns/ (n. 会议;大会) about mental health. Can you **play** /pleɪ/ (v. 演奏;玩;扮演) some music **or** create art that shows hope?"

Sarah felt her heart race. She had never done public work. But Mr. Chen put a hand on her shoulder. "This is your chance," he said. "Art can **preserve** /prɪˈzɜːrv/ (v. 保护;保存) memory, but it can also create new hope."

**Throughout** /θruːˈaʊt/ (prep./adv. 遍及;自始至终) the next week, Sarah worked on a **spectacular** /spekˈtækjələr/ (adj. 壮观的;引人注目的) painting. It showed the **coast**, with a small figure taking **flight** toward the sun. She called it "**Well-being** /ˌwel ˈbiːɪŋ/ (n. 幸福;安康)." The image was simple but powerful. She wanted to **extend** /ɪkˈstend/ (v. 延伸;扩展) the message: healing is possible.

At the **conference**, people gathered **close** /kloʊs/ (adv./adj. 靠近地;接近的;v. 关闭) to see the work. A man who studied **psychology** /saɪˈkɑːlədʒi/ (n. 心理学) said it was beautiful. "I **bet** /bet/ (v. 打赌;确信) this will help many people," he said. Lisa **respond** /rɪˈspɑːnd/ (v. 回应;反应) ed with tears. "It shows what we're trying to say but can't find words for."

Later, an **alien** /ˈeɪliən/ (adj./n. 外国的;陌生的;外星人) feeling came over Sarah—not foreign, but new. She realized she wasn't just painting the sea. She was painting life itself. Mr. Chen was right: she had to **engage** with the world.

The conference focused on several topics, including **AIDS** /eɪdz/ (n. 艾滋病), **suicide** /ˈsuːɪsaɪd/ (n. 自杀), and **tradition** /trəˈdɪʃn/ (n. 传统) al healing. There was even a talk about **theology** /θiˈɑːlədʒi/ (n. 神学) and its role in **well-being**. One speaker mentioned a **lion** /ˈlaɪən/ (n. 狮子) as a symbol of courage. Another talked about how art could **hit** /hɪt/ (v. 打击;击中;达到) the heart directly.

That night, Sarah said **goodbye** /ˌɡʊdˈbaɪ/ (interj./n. 再见) to Mr. Chen. Not forever—just for the evening. "Thank you," she said. "You helped me find my **secret** /ˈsiːkrət/ (n./adj. 秘密;秘密的): I'm not painting **for** myself. I'm painting for others."

He smiled. "Then you've learned the most important lesson. Art isn't about being perfect. It's about being **sensitive** /ˈsensətɪv/ (adj. 敏感的;体贴的) to others' pain."

Sarah walked home under the stars. She felt **confident** now, not because she was a great artist, but because she had found purpose. The **whole** world seemed different. She wouldn't **quit**. She would **play** her part, one painting at a time.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

这个海岸小镇早晨很安静。莎拉坐在小商店的窗边,用一碗鸡汤暖手。她来这里画海,但发现了更重要的东西:一个留下来的理由。

店主陈先生是一位因疾病失去儿子的成年人。那个男孩想成为飞行员,在整个世界飞行。陈先生在墙上挂着一个相框,里面有儿子的照片。"我确信他在看着我们,"他会说。

莎拉对自己的艺术不自信。她想过很多次要放弃。但陈先生鼓励她。"别傻了,"他说。"你有天赋。你必须与世界接触,否则你会后悔的。"

一天,一位年轻女子来到商店。她叫丽莎,在民用医院工作。她看起来很累,情绪上很疲惫。"我需要帮助,"她说。"我们正在举办一个关于心理健康的会议。你能演奏一些音乐或创作展示希望的艺术吗?"

莎拉感到心跳加速。她从未做过公共作品。但陈先生把手放在她的肩膀上。"这是你的机会,"他说。"艺术可以保存记忆,但它也可以创造新的希望。"

整整一周,莎拉都在创作一幅壮观的画作。它展示了海岸,一个小人物朝着太阳飞翔。她把它叫做"幸福"。这个图像简单但有力。她想要延伸这个信息:治愈是可能的。

在会议上,人们聚集得很近来看这幅作品。一位研究心理学的男人说它很美。"我确信这会帮助很多人,"他说。丽莎流着泪回应。"它展示了我们试图说但找不到词语的东西。"

后来,莎拉产生了一种陌生的感觉——不是外国的,而是新的。她意识到自己不只是在画海。她在画生活本身。陈先生是对的:她必须与世界接触。

会议聚焦于几个主题,包括艾滋病、自杀和传统治疗。甚至还有一个关于神学及其在幸福中的作用的讲座。一位演讲者提到狮子作为勇气的象征。另一位谈到艺术如何能直接击中人心。

那天晚上,莎拉向陈先生说再见。不是永远——只是当晚。"谢谢你,"她说。"你帮我找到了我的秘密:我不是为自己画画。我是为别人画画。"

他微笑着。"那么你已经学到了最重要的一课。艺术不是关于完美。而是关于对他人的痛苦保持敏感。"

莎拉在星空下走回家。她现在感到自信,不是因为她是一位伟大的艺术家,而是因为她找到了目标。整个世界看起来都不同了。她不会放弃。她会扮演自己的角色,一次一幅画。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子1
**原句:** "You must engage with the world, or you'll regret it."

**分析:** 使用"or"表示否则的后果,形成条件关系。"engage with"是固定搭配,表示"与...接触/参与"。

**要点:** "or"在这里不是"或者",而是"否则"的意思,警告不行动的后果。

---

### 句子2
**原句:** "Art can preserve memory, but it can also create new hope."

**分析:** "not only...but also"的变体,使用"can...but can also"来展示两个功能。对比"preserve"(保存过去)和"create"(创造未来)。

**要点:** 使用对比来展现事物的多面性,使论述更完整。

---

### 句子3
**原句:** "Throughout the next week, Sarah worked on a spectacular painting."

**分析:** "Throughout"作时间介词,强调整个时间段的持续性。"work on"表示"从事于,努力做"。

**要点:** Throughout强调"自始至终",比"during"更强调完整性和持续性。

---

### 句子4
**原句:** "She felt confident now, not because she was a great artist, but because she had found purpose."

**分析:** "not because...but because..."结构清晰地对比两个原因,强调真正的原因。这是高级的因果解释方式。

**要点:** 这种结构能够纠正误解,引导读者理解真正的原因。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 焦点1: 情态动词表达建议和必要性

**原句:** "You must engage with the world, or you'll regret it."

**聚焦:** 情态动词must + 连词or

**用法:** "must"表示强烈建议或必要性,"or"连接后果。这种组合常用于警告或劝告。注意"you'll"是"you will"的缩写,表示将来的后果。

**可替换句:** "If you don't engage with the world, you'll regret it." (用条件句,更正式但不够简洁)

---

### 焦点2: 现在完成时表达经验

**原句:** "She had never done public work."

**聚焦:** 过去完成时 (had + never + past participle)

**用法:** 在过去的某个时间点之前,"从未"有过某种经历。"never"放在助动词和过去分词之间。

**可替换句:** "She never did public work before." (一般过去时,但不够强调"之前从未"的含义)
