**#SliceOfLife** – A story of resilience and community

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

**Professor** /prəˈfesər/ (n. 教授) Helen Carter sat in her office at the **university** /ˌjuːnɪˈvɜːrsəti/ (n. 大学), staring at the **survey** /ˈsɜːrveɪ/ (n. 调查) results spread across her desk. Her **former** /ˈfɔːrmər/ (adj. 以前的) students had reported feeling disconnected during the pandemic. The **absence** /ˈæbsəns/ (n. 缺席；缺乏) of in-person classes had taken a toll. She felt **disappointed** /ˌdɪsəˈpɔɪntɪd/ (adj. 失望的), but not defeated.

The **deadline** /ˈdedlaɪn/ (n. 截止日期) for her proposal was approaching fast. She wanted to create a **forum** /ˈfɔːrəm/ (n. 论坛；讨论会) where students could share their struggles and **cope** /koʊp/ (v. 应对) with stress. "We need to **prevent** /prɪˈvent/ (v. 预防；阻止) mental health crises before they happen," she thought. It wasn't just about grades anymore—it was about helping young people **endure** /ɪnˈdʊr/ (v. 忍受；持久) difficult times.

Helen walked down the **aisle** /aɪl/ (n. 过道；走廊) of the lecture hall, remembering when it was full of eager faces. Now, half the seats were empty. A **collective** /kəˈlektɪv/ (adj. 集体的) sadness hung in the air. One student had recently been diagnosed with **cancer** /ˈkænsər/ (n. 癌症), and others struggled with grief. Helen knew she had to **try** /traɪ/ (v. 尝试) something different.

She reached out to the **parliament** /ˈpɑːrləmənt/ (n. 议会) of student organizations and proposed a wellness initiative. "Think of it as a **pro** /proʊ/ (n./adj. 专业人员；赞成的) support system," she explained at the meeting. "We need to **monitor** /ˈmɑːnɪtər/ (v. 监控；监视) student wellbeing, not just their test scores. The **provision** /prəˈvɪʒn/ (n. 提供；规定) of mental health resources should be our priority."

To her surprise, the response was **super** /ˈsuːpər/ (adj. 超级的；极好的) positive. Students wanted to feel heard. One young woman spoke up: "**Professor** Carter, may I lend you an **ear** /ɪr/ (n. 耳朵；倾听)? I think many of us have been **asleep** /əˈsliːp/ (adj. 睡着的；麻木的) to our own pain. We need this."

Helen felt **pleased** /pliːzd/ (adj. 高兴的). After weeks of planning, the forum launched. It wasn't perfect—some students had to **drop** /drɑːp/ (v. 放弃；下降) out due to schedule conflicts—but it was a start. The initiative even attracted a visiting speaker who discussed how ancient societies would **portray** /pɔːrˈtreɪ/ (v. 描绘；扮演) healing as a communal act.

By the semester's end, Helen reached a clear **conclusion** /kənˈkluːʒn/ (n. 结论): Education wasn't only about filling minds with facts. It was about creating spaces where people could **endure** the hardest chapters of their lives and emerge stronger. In a **low** /loʊ/ (adj. 低的；沮丧的) moment, she had found a high purpose. And that, she realized, was worth every effort.

The university had been spared a **terrorist** /ˈterərɪst/ (n. 恐怖分子) attack years ago, but the real terror was isolation and silence. Helen's work was quiet, unglamorous, but deeply necessary.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

海伦·卡特教授坐在她的大学办公室里，盯着桌上摊开的调查结果。她以前的学生们报告说在疫情期间感到失联。缺乏面对面课程造成了损失。她感到失望，但没有被打败。

她提案的截止日期正快速临近。她想创建一个论坛，让学生们可以分享他们的困难并应对压力。"我们需要在心理健康危机发生之前预防它们，"她想。这不再仅仅是关于成绩——而是关于帮助年轻人忍受困难时期。

海伦走在讲堂的过道上，记得那时候满是热切面孔的场景。现在，一半的座位都是空的。一种集体的悲伤悬在空气中。一名学生最近被诊断出癌症，其他人则在与悲伤作斗争。海伦知道她必须尝试一些不同的东西。

她联系了学生组织的议会，并提议了一个健康倡议。"把它想象成一个专业支持系统，"她在会议上解释道。"我们需要监控学生的幸福感，而不仅仅是他们的考试成绩。心理健康资源的提供应该是我们的优先事项。"

令她惊讶的是，反应非常积极。学生们想被倾听。一位年轻女子说话了："卡特教授，我可以倾听您吗？我认为我们中的许多人一直对自己的痛苦麻木不觉。我们需要这个。"

海伦感到高兴。经过数周的计划，论坛启动了。它并不完美——一些学生因为日程冲突不得不放弃——但这是一个开始。该倡议甚至吸引了一位访问演讲者，讨论古代社会如何将治愈描绘为一种集体行为。

到学期末，海伦得出了一个明确的结论：教育不仅仅是用事实填满头脑。它是关于创造空间，让人们能够忍受生命中最艰难的章节，并变得更强大。在一个低谷时刻，她找到了崇高的目标。她意识到，这值得付出所有努力。

这所大学多年前曾免于一次恐怖分子袭击，但真正的恐怖是孤立和沉默。海伦的工作安静、不引人注目，但却深深必要。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子1
**原句：** "The absence of in-person classes had taken a toll."

**分析：** "take a toll" 是固定搭配，意为"造成损失/产生负面影响"。这个表达生动地传达了疫情对教育的影响，比简单说"caused problems"更有文学性。

---

### 句子2
**原句：** "We need to prevent mental health crises before they happen."

**分析：** 使用"before they happen"强调预防性措施的重要性。这种结构（prevent... before...）在讨论公共健康和安全话题时非常常见。

---

### 句子3
**原句：** "A collective sadness hung in the air."

**分析：** 拟人化和感官描写的结合。"hung in the air"将抽象情绪具象化，让读者能够"感受"到气氛。这种写法比直接说"everyone was sad"更有感染力。

---

### 句子4
**原句：** "Can you lend me your ear?"

**分析：** "lend someone your ear"是习语，意为"倾听"。来源于莎士比亚，这个表达比简单的"listen to me"更加正式和富有文学色彩。

---

**分析：** 使用对比修辞（low vs. high）创造戏剧性效果。这种对比突出了人物的转变和故事的主题：在困境中找到意义。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦（Grammar Focus）

### 焦点1：过去完成时表示影响（Past Perfect for Consequence）

**原句：** "The absence of in-person classes had taken a toll."

**聚焦：** 过去完成时（had taken）

**用法：** 表示在故事叙述时间点之前发生的事情对当前产生的影响。"had taken a toll"强调这个影响已经形成并持续存在。

**可替换句：** The absence of in-person classes took a toll.（一般过去时，时间层次感较弱）

---

### 焦点2：情态动词 + 动词原形（Modal + Infinitive）

**原句：** "We need to prevent mental health crises before they happen."

**聚焦：** need to + 动词原形（prevent）

**用法：** "need to"表示必要性，后接动词原形。这种结构用于表达责任、义务或强烈的建议，比"should"语气更强。

**可替换句：** We should prevent mental health crises before they happen.（should语气较弱，表示建议而非必需）
