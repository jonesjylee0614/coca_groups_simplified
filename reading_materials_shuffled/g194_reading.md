## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Emma stood in her **grandmother** /ˈɡrænmʌðər/ (n. 祖母)'s house, holding a box of old **clothes** /kloʊðz/ (n. 衣服). The room smelled **clean** /kliːn/ (adj. 干净的；v. 清洁), like lemon and soap. Her grandmother had passed away last month, and **although** /ɔːlˈðoʊ/ (conj. 虽然；尽管) the loss hurt deeply, Emma found **hope** /hoʊp/ (n. 希望；v. 希望) in preserving her memory.

"These are from when she was in **college** /ˈkɑːlɪdʒ/ (n. 大学)," Emma's mother said, pointing to a **pink** /pɪŋk/ (adj. 粉红色的；n. 粉红色) dress. Emma smiled. She couldn't imagine her serious grandmother wearing something so bright. The **community** /kəˈmjuːnəti/ (n. 社区；团体) had loved her—she organized **weekly** /ˈwiːkli/ (adj. 每周的；adv. 每周) gatherings for seniors.

Emma's **baby** /ˈbeɪbi/ (n. 婴儿；宝贝) sister, only **nine** /naɪn/ (num. 九) months old, crawled across the floor. "Be careful," Emma warned. "Don't **damage** /ˈdæmɪdʒ/ (v. 损坏；n. 损害) anything." Their mother laughed. "Your grandmother would say, '**Use** /juːz/ (v. 使用；n. 用途) things, don't **hide** /haɪd/ (v. 隐藏；躲藏) them away.'"

That wisdom reminded Emma of a story her grandmother once told about testifying in a **courtroom** /ˈkɔːrtruːm/ (n. 法庭). She had witnessed an **accident** /ˈæksɪdənt/ (n. 事故；意外) involving a **marine** /məˈriːn/ (adj. 海洋的；n. 海军陆战队员) who'd been injured during a **football** /ˈfʊtbɔːl/ (n. 橄榄球；足球) game. The case involved a faulty **circuit** /ˈsɜːrkɪt/ (n. 电路；回路) in the stadium lights. Her testimony helped **confirm** /kənˈfɜːrm/ (v. 确认；证实) what really happened, **partly** /ˈpɑːrtli/ (adv. 部分地；在一定程度上) because she had studied basic **chemistry** /ˈkemɪstri/ (n. 化学) and understood the technical aspects.

"She was brave," Emma said. Her mother nodded. "The **opposite** /ˈɑːpəzɪt/ (adj. 相反的；n. 对立面) of a coward. She never let fear stop her." Emma thought about her own life. She had been accepted to study marine biology, an **equivalent** /ɪˈkwɪvələnt/ (adj. 等同的；n. 等价物) of her grandmother's courage in a different field.

"I **hope** /hoʊp/ (v. 希望；n. 希望) I can be as strong," Emma whispered. She picked up a photo of her grandmother standing in front of the ocean. The woman looked **fast** /fæst/ (adj. 快的；adv. 快速地)-paced and determined, not slowing down for anyone. Her grandmother had been a **Democrat** /ˈdeməkræt/ (n. 民主党人；民主主义者), fighting for environmental protection in their coastal **community** /kəˈmjuːnəti/ (n. 社区；团体).

Emma decided she wouldn't **hide** /haɪd/ (v. 隐藏；躲藏) from challenges. She'd face them head-on, just like her grandmother would have wanted. **Although** /ɔːlˈðoʊ/ (conj. 虽然；尽管) saying goodbye was hard, carrying forward her legacy felt right.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

艾玛站在祖母的房子里，手里拿着一盒旧衣服。房间闻起来很干净，像柠檬和肥皂的味道。她的祖母上个月去世了，尽管失去她很痛苦，艾玛还是在保存她的记忆中找到了希望。

"这些是她上大学时的，"艾玛的母亲指着一条粉红色连衣裙说。艾玛笑了。她无法想象严肃的祖母会穿这么鲜艳的衣服。社区的人都爱她——她每周为老年人组织聚会。

艾玛只有九个月大的宝贝妹妹在地板上爬来爬去。"小心点，"艾玛警告道。"别损坏任何东西。"她们的母亲笑了。"你祖母会说，'使用东西，不要把它们藏起来。'"

那份智慧让艾玛想起了祖母曾讲过的一个关于在法庭上作证的故事。她目睹了一次涉及一名海军陆战队员在橄榄球比赛中受伤的事故。案件涉及体育场灯光的故障电路。她的证词帮助确认了真实情况，部分原因是她学过基础化学，理解技术方面的内容。

"她很勇敢，"艾玛说。她母亲点点头。"与懦夫相反。她从不让恐惧阻止她。"艾玛想起了自己的生活。她已被录取学习海洋生物学，这相当于祖母在不同领域的勇气。

"我希望我能一样坚强，"艾玛低声说。她拿起一张祖母站在海洋前的照片。那个女人看起来节奏很快，意志坚定，不为任何人放慢脚步。她的祖母是一名民主党人，在他们的沿海社区为环境保护而奋斗。

艾玛决定她不会逃避挑战。她会正面迎接它们，就像她的祖母希望的那样。虽然告别很难，但传承她的遗产感觉是对的。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Although the loss hurt deeply, Emma found hope in preserving her memory."

**分析:** "Although"引导让步状语从句，表示转折关系。"find... in..."表示"在...中找到..."。"preserving"是动名词，作介词"in"的宾语。

**亮点:** 让步从句置于句首，强调了情感的对比和转折。

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Your grandmother would say, 'Use things, don't hide them away.'"

**分析:** "would"表示过去的习惯性动作（"过去常常"）。直接引语中包含祈使句，用逗号分隔两个命令。

**亮点:** 通过直接引语让已故的角色"说话"，增加情感真实度。

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Her testimony helped confirm what really happened, partly because she had studied basic chemistry."

**分析:** "help + 动词原形"结构。"what"引导宾语从句。"partly because"解释部分原因，"had studied"表示在作证之前已经学过。

**亮点:** 展示了知识如何在实际情境中发挥作用，连接过去学习与现在应用。

### 句子 4
**原句:** "She was brave. The opposite of a coward."

**分析:** 两个简短句子形成对比。第二句是一个省略句（完整形式：She was the opposite of a coward），通过省略增强节奏感。

**亮点:** 短句和断句增加了语言的力度和情感强度。

### 句子 5
**原句:** "Although saying goodbye was hard, carrying forward her legacy felt right."

**分析:** "Although"再次引导让步从句。两个动名词短语"saying goodbye"和"carrying forward"作主语，形成对比。

**亮点:** 平行结构（两个动名词主语）创造了对称美，强化了情感对比。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦（Grammar Focus）

### 焦点 1: "would" 表示过去的习惯

**原句:** "Your grandmother would say, 'Use things, don't hide them away.'"

**聚焦:** "would" 表示过去反复发生的动作或习惯

**用法:** 当回忆过去某人的习惯性行为时，用"would + 动词原形"，比"used to"更口语化，常带有怀念的情感色彩。

**可替换句:** "Your grandmother used to say, 'Use things, don't hide them away.'"

**区别:** "used to"更中性，"would"更有情感温度，常用于讲故事和回忆。

### 焦点 2: 让步状语从句的情感运用

**原句:** "Although saying goodbye was hard, carrying forward her legacy felt right."

**聚焦:** "although" 引导的让步从句

**用法:** "Although"承认一个困难或负面的事实，但主句强调积极的行动或结果。这种结构常用于表达复杂情感或矛盾心理。

**可替换句:** "Saying goodbye was hard, but carrying forward her legacy felt right."

**区别:** "but"更直接，"although"结构更正式，情感层次更丰富。
