**#Adventure** – A Journey Through the Jungle

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **mayor** /ˈmeɪər/ (n. 市长) stood **in** /ɪn/ (prep. 在...里面) front of the old map, tracing his finger along the **jungle** /ˈdʒʌŋɡl/ (n. 丛林) paths. "This doesn't **mean** /miːn/ (v. 意味着) we give up," he said to his **assistant** /əˈsɪstənt/ (n. 助手). The **legend** /ˈledʒənd/ (n. 传说) of the lost city **used** /juːzd/ (v. 使用；过去式) to **be** /biː/ (v. 是) dismissed as myth, **but** /bʌt/ (conj. 但是) recent findings had changed everything.

Maria, the mayor's assistant, began her **review** /rɪˈvjuː/ (n. 审查；回顾) of the supplies. **Orange** /ˈɔːrɪndʒ/ (n. 橙子；橙色) and **lemon** /ˈlemən/ (n. 柠檬) juice would help prevent illness, she noted. The **state** /steɪt/ (n. 状态；国家) of their equipment was good. She could only **guess** /ɡes/ (v. 猜测) what they might find, but the **integration** /ˌɪntɪˈɡreɪʃn/ (n. 整合；融合) of modern technology with traditional knowledge gave her hope.

"We need to **re** /riː/ (prefix 重新)-examine the route," she suggested. "Let me **pick** /pɪk/ (v. 挑选；采摘) the best path." The **guard** /ɡɑːrd/ (n. 守卫；警卫) who would accompany them had experience **in** ancient **Latin** /ˈlætɪn/ (n. 拉丁语) inscriptions. His **input** /ˈɪnpʊt/ (n. 输入；意见) would **be** valuable when they reached the ruins.

The expedition team gathered **nearby** /ˌnɪrˈbaɪ/ (adv. 在附近) the town square. Their findings were **widely** /ˈwaɪdli/ (adv. 广泛地) anticipated **by** the local **society** /səˈsaɪəti/ (n. 社会). This journey would **cover** /ˈkʌvər/ (v. 覆盖；包含) over fifty miles of dense terrain. Each member of the **class** /klæs/ (n. 班级；阶级) of explorers knew the risks, **but** they pressed forward anyway.

Three days **in**, they found the first stone marker. After **dessert** /dɪˈzɜːrt/ (n. 甜点) that evening, Maria studied the symbols **by** firelight. The **legend** was real—**and** it was **nearby**.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

市长站在旧地图前,手指沿着丛林路径移动。"这并不意味着我们放弃,"他对助手说。失落之城的传说过去常被当作神话而被否定,但最近的发现改变了一切。

市长的助手玛丽亚开始审查补给品。橙汁和柠檬汁能帮助预防疾病,她记下了这一点。他们装备的状态很好。她只能猜测他们可能会发现什么,但现代技术与传统知识的整合给了她希望。

"我们需要重新检查路线,"她建议道。"让我挑选最佳路径。"将要陪同他们的警卫在古代拉丁语铭文方面有经验。当他们到达遗址时,他的意见将非常有价值。

探险队在城镇广场附近集合。当地社会广泛期待他们的发现。这次旅程将覆盖五十多英里的茂密地形。这个探险者阶层的每个成员都知道风险,但他们还是继续前进。

进入第三天,他们发现了第一个石头标记。那天晚上吃完甜点后,玛丽亚在火光旁研究那些符号。传说是真的——而且就在附近。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The legend of the lost city used to be dismissed as myth, but recent findings had changed everything."

**分析:** "used to" 表示过去的习惯或状态,强调现在已不再如此。被动语态 "be dismissed as" 表示"被当作...而否定"。"but" 引导的转折强调了变化的重要性。

**亮点:** 这种对比结构(过去 vs. 现在)在叙事中很有效,能够快速建立故事的背景和转折点。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "The integration of modern technology with traditional knowledge gave her hope."

**分析:** "integration of A with B" 是固定搭配,表示"A与B的整合"。整个名词短语作主语,谓语是简单的 "gave",宾语补足语是抽象名词 "hope"。

**亮点:** 将抽象概念(整合)与具体情感(希望)联系起来,使句子既有深度又易于理解。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Their findings were widely anticipated by the local society."

**分析:** 被动语态 "were anticipated" 强调动作的接受者(findings),副词 "widely" 修饰动词,增强了期待的程度。介词短语 "by the local society" 说明动作的执行者。

**亮点:** 被动语态在学术和正式写作中很常见,能够将焦点放在重要信息上。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Each member of the class of explorers knew the risks, but they pressed forward anyway."

**分析:** "each member" 作主语时谓语用单数,"but" 连接的后句用 "they" 指代全体成员。"press forward" 是习语,表示"继续前进","anyway" 强调不顾困难的决心。

**亮点:** 从单数到复数的转换自然流畅,体现了个人与集体的关系,同时 "anyway" 的使用增强了语气。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "used to" 的用法

**原句:** "The legend of the lost city used to be dismissed as myth, but recent findings had changed everything."

**聚焦:** "used to + 动词原形" 结构

**用法说明:**
"used to" 表示过去的习惯、状态或反复发生的动作,强调现在已不再如此。注意区分:
- "used to do": 过去常常做(现在不做了)
- "be used to doing": 习惯于做某事
- "be used to do": 被用来做某事

**可替换句:** "In the past, people dismissed the legend of the lost city as myth, but recent findings changed everything."

---

### 聚焦点 2: 被动语态的使用

**原句:** "Their findings were widely anticipated by the local society."

**聚焦:** 被动语态 (were anticipated)

**用法说明:**
被动语态用于强调动作的接受者而非执行者,或当执行者不重要、不明确时使用。结构为 "be + 过去分词"。在正式写作和学术文章中,被动语态使用频率较高。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: Their findings
- 谓语: were anticipated
- 状语: widely
- 介词短语: by the local society

**可替换句:** "The local society widely anticipated their findings." (主动语态)
