## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Marcus sat on a **flat** /flæt/ (adj. 平坦的) **bench** /bentʃ/ (n. 长凳) **in** the **park** /pɑːrk/ (n. 公园), watching kids play **baseball** /ˈbeɪsbɔːl/ (n. 棒球). The idea seemed **ridiculous** /rɪˈdɪkjələs/ (adj. 荒谬的) at first—how could he **establish** /ɪˈstæblɪʃ/ (v. 建立) a career **in** this **profession** /prəˈfeʃn/ (n. 职业) at his age? But watching the game sparked something **in** him he thought he'd lost: the will to **fight** /faɪt/ (v./n. 战斗；奋斗).

The **topic** /ˈtɑːpɪk/ (n. 话题) had come up at dinner. His daughter had asked, "Dad, what would you do if you could **leave** /liːv/ (v. 离开) your job?" It was **not** /nɑːt/ (adv. 不) a simple question. Marcus worked **in** **mortgage** /ˈmɔːrɡɪdʒ/ (n. 抵押贷款) lending—a **comprehensive** /ˌkɑːmprɪˈhensɪv/ (adj. 全面的) but soul-**drain** /dreɪn/ (v. 消耗；排水)-ing role that paid well but gave him no joy.

"**In** **addition** /əˈdɪʃn/ (n. 增加；此外) to your salary," his wife had said, "you need something that will **boost** /buːst/ (v. 提升；促进) your spirit." She was right. Every day felt **rough** /rʌf/ (adj. 艰难的；粗糙的). The **display** /dɪˈspleɪ/ (n./v. 展示) of numbers on his computer screen meant nothing. He didn't **hate** /heɪt/ (v. 憎恨) the work, but he didn't love it either.

Now, watching a young player **step** /step/ (v./n. 踏步；步骤) up to the plate, Marcus remembered his own dreams. He'd wanted to coach, to teach kids the **crystal** /ˈkrɪstl/ (adj. 清澈的；n. 水晶)-clear lessons that sports offer. The **rating** /ˈreɪtɪŋ/ (n. 评分；等级) system at his company meant nothing compared to seeing a child's face light up.

A **jet** /dʒet/ (n. 喷气式飞机) flew overhead. Marcus made a decision. He would **not** quit tomorrow, but he would take **step**-s. He would **insist** /ɪnˈsɪst/ (v. 坚持) on making time for what mattered. Even a **beast** /biːst/ (n. 野兽) of a **mortgage** payment couldn't keep him from living. He stood, walked to where the kids were playing, and asked, "Need a coach?"

His **palm** /pɑːm/ (n. 手掌) tingled with nervous energy. This was the first **step**.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

马库斯坐在公园里的一张平坦长凳上,看着孩子们打棒球。这个想法一开始看起来很荒谬——他怎么能在这个年纪在这个职业建立事业呢?但看着比赛,点燃了他以为已经失去的东西:奋斗的意志。

这个话题在晚餐时出现了。他女儿问:"爸爸,如果你能离开你的工作,你会做什么?"这不是一个简单的问题。马库斯从事抵押贷款业务——一个全面但消耗灵魂的角色,薪水不错但没有给他带来快乐。

"除了你的薪水,"他妻子说,"你需要一些能提升你精神的东西。"她是对的。每一天都感觉很艰难。他电脑屏幕上显示的数字毫无意义。他不憎恨这份工作,但也不热爱它。

现在,看着一个年轻球员走上击球位,马库斯记起了自己的梦想。他曾想当教练,教孩子们体育所提供的清晰明了的课程。与看到孩子脸上的光芒相比,他公司的评级系统毫无意义。

一架喷气式飞机飞过头顶。马库斯做出了决定。他不会明天就辞职,但他会采取步骤。他会坚持为重要的事情腾出时间。即使是庞大的抵押贷款也不能阻止他生活。他站起来,走到孩子们玩耍的地方,问道:"需要教练吗?"

他的手掌因紧张的能量而刺痛。这是第一步。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The idea seemed ridiculous at first—how could he establish a career in this profession at his age?"

**分析:** "seem + 形容词" 表示"看起来..."。破折号后的疑问句解释了为什么看起来荒谬。"at his age" 是介词短语,强调年龄因素。

**亮点:** 这种先陈述感受再解释原因的结构,让读者能够跟随主人公的思维过程,增强代入感。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Marcus worked in mortgage lending—a comprehensive but soul-draining role that paid well but gave him no joy."

**分析:** 破折号后的同位语进一步解释 "mortgage lending"。"but" 连接两对对比:comprehensive but soul-draining, paid well but gave no joy,形成双重对比。

**亮点:** 这种双重对比的修辞手法强有力地表达了工作的矛盾性质——物质富足但精神空虚。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "In addition to your salary, you need something that will boost your spirit."

**分析:** "in addition to" 是固定短语,表示"除了...之外"。定语从句 "that will boost your spirit" 修饰 "something",使用将来时表示期望。

**亮点:** 这句话简洁地点出了物质与精神的对比,是故事的核心主题之一。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Even a beast of a mortgage payment couldn't keep him from living."

**分析:** "a beast of a..." 是口语化表达,表示"庞大的/令人讨厌的..."。"keep sb. from doing" 表示"阻止某人做某事"。

**亮点:** 使用 "beast" 这个生动的比喻将抽象的财务压力具象化,使句子更有冲击力。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "in addition to" 的用法

**原句:** "In addition to your salary, you need something that will boost your spirit."

**聚焦:** 介词短语 "in addition to"

**用法说明:**
"in addition to" 表示"除了...之外(还)",强调添加更多内容。后面跟名词或动名词。注意与 "besides" 和 "except" 的区别:
- "in addition to" = 除了...之外,还有
- "besides" = 除了...之外,还有(较口语化)
- "except" = 除了...之外(不包括)

**例句:**
- In addition to English, she speaks Spanish.
- Besides studying, he also works part-time.
- Everyone went except John.

**可替换句:** "Besides your salary, you need something that will boost your spirit."

---

### 聚焦点 2: "keep...from..." 结构

**原句:** "Even a beast of a mortgage payment couldn't keep him from living."

**聚焦:** "keep sb./sth. from doing" 结构

**用法说明:**
"keep...from..." 表示"阻止...做某事"或"使...不做某事"。这是一个常用的结构,注意 "from" 后面要用动名词形式。

**结构分析:**
- keep + 宾语 + from + 动名词
- 否定形式通常在 keep 前加 not 或使用 can't/couldn't

**可替换句:** 
- "Even a beast of a mortgage payment couldn't stop him from living."
