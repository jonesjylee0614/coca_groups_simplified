## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Dr. Sarah Chen sat in her office, sipping **tea** /tiː/ (n. 茶) as she reviewed her **plan** /plæn/ (n. 计划) for the day. As a **surgeon** /ˈsɜːrdʒən/ (n. 外科医生), she worked for a medical **organization** /ˌɔːrɡənaɪˈzeɪʃn/ (n. 组织) that served low-income families. **Recently** /ˈriːsntli/ (adv. 最近), she'd noticed something **subtle** /ˈsʌtl/ (adj. 微妙的) but troubling: many patients **ignore**-d /ɪɡˈnɔːr/ (v. 忽视) early symptoms, waiting **until** their conditions became serious.

Today's first patient was Marcus, a **painter** /ˈpeɪntər/ (n. 画家) with breathing problems. Dr. Chen needed to **examine** /ɪɡˈzæmɪn/ (v. 检查) his **lung**-s /lʌŋ/ (n. 肺). "**In** **spite** /spaɪt/ (n. 恶意) of what you might think," she said gently, "**testing** /ˈtestɪŋ/ (n. 测试) is important. We need to **predict** /prɪˈdɪkt/ (v. 预测) problems before they worsen."

Marcus shifted nervously, giving her a quick **glance** /ɡlæns/ (n./v. 一瞥). "I can't afford expensive treatments, **Doc**. **Thus** /ðʌs/ (adv. 因此), I've been putting it off." Sarah understood. The **supply** /səˈplaɪ/ (n. 供应) of affordable care was **unlikely** /ʌnˈlaɪkli/ (adj. 不太可能的) to improve **sometime** soon without policy changes.

She pulled up his test results on her computer's **interface** /ˈɪntərfeɪs/ (n. 界面). "Good news—nothing serious. But you need more **protein** /ˈproʊtiːn/ (n. 蛋白质) and less **fat** /fæt/ (n. 脂肪) in your diet. Your body is a **secondary** /ˈsekənderi/ (adj. 次要的) concern to art, I know, but you can't paint if you're sick."

Marcus smiled weakly. "My wife says the same thing. She's become quite the **celebrity** /səˈlebrəti/ (n. 名人) chef in our neighborhood." They discussed simple changes—adding beans for **protein**, walking daily. Nothing radical, but effective.

Later, Sarah attended a staff meeting where they reviewed patient outcomes. A **competitor** /kəmˈpetɪtər/ (n. 竞争对手) hospital had published impressive statistics, but Sarah knew their methods. "Their **title** /ˈtaɪtl/ (n. 标题；头衔) might say 'leading hospital,' but they cherry-pick patients. We treat everyone."

That evening, as Sarah walked home, she thought about Marcus. **In** spite of limited resources, they were making a difference. The **fact** /fækt/ (n. 事实) was, every patient mattered—**celebrity** or painter, rich or poor. Her work wasn't glamorous, but it was real. And **thus**, it was worth doing.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

陈莎拉医生坐在办公室里,一边喝茶,一边审查当天的计划。作为一名外科医生,她为一家为低收入家庭服务的医疗组织工作。最近,她注意到一些微妙但令人不安的事情:许多患者忽视早期症状,等到病情严重才就医。

今天的第一位病人是马库斯,一位有呼吸问题的画家。陈医生需要检查他的肺。"尽管你可能这样想,"她温和地说,"但测试很重要。我们需要在问题恶化之前预测它们。"

马库斯紧张地动了动,快速瞥了她一眼。"我负担不起昂贵的治疗,医生。因此,我一直在拖延。"莎拉理解。如果没有政策改变,负担得起的医疗供应在某个时候改善的可能性不大。

她在电脑界面上调出他的测试结果。"好消息——没什么严重的。但你需要在饮食中增加更多蛋白质,减少脂肪。我知道你的身体对艺术来说是次要的关注点,但如果你生病了就不能画画了。"

马库斯苦笑。"我妻子也这么说。她已经成为我们社区里相当有名的厨师。"他们讨论了简单的改变——添加豆类获取蛋白质,每天散步。没什么激进的,但很有效。

后来,莎拉参加了员工会议,审查患者的治疗效果。一家竞争对手医院发布了令人印象深刻的统计数据,但莎拉知道他们的方法。"他们的标题可能说'领先医院',但他们挑选患者。我们治疗每个人。"

那天晚上,当莎拉走路回家时,她想起了马库斯。尽管资源有限,他们正在产生影响。事实是,每个病人都很重要——无论是名人还是画家,富人还是穷人。她的工作并不光鲜,但它是真实的。因此,它值得去做。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "In spite of" 的用法

**原句:** "In spite of what you might think, testing is important."

**聚焦:** "in spite of" + 名词/名词短语

**用法说明:**
"In spite of" 是介词短语,后面接名词、代词或名词性从句,表示"尽管;虽然"。它与 "despite" 同义,但不能接句子(需要用 "although" 引导从句)。

**结构对比:**
- In spite of + 名词: "In spite of the rain, we went out."
- Despite + 名词: "Despite the rain, we went out."
- Although + 句子: "Although it rained, we went out."

**更多例句:**
- "In spite of her fear, she climbed the mountain."
- "He succeeded in spite of many obstacles."

**可替换句:** "Although you might think otherwise, testing is important." (用从句)

### 聚焦点 2: "be unlikely to do" 表示可能性

**原句:** "The supply of affordable care was unlikely to improve sometime soon."

**聚焦:** be unlikely to + 动词原形

**用法说明:**
"be unlikely to do" 表示"不太可能做某事",是表达可能性的常用结构。相反的表达是 "be likely to do"(很可能)。

**可能性程度词:**
- Certain: will definitely
- Very likely: be likely to
- Possible: may/might
- Unlikely: be unlikely to
- Impossible: will not

**更多例句:**
- "She is unlikely to agree with that plan."
