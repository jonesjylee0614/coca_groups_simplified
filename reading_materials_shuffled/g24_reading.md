**#MoralReflection** – A story of healing and hope

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Dr. Sarah Chen stood at the **bottom** /ˈbɑːtəm/ (n. 底部) of the valley, where a small clinic served a **cluster** /ˈklʌstər/ (n. 群) of villages. She had left her **official** /əˈfɪʃl/ (adj. 官方的) position at the city hospital to work here. The **burden** /ˈbɜːrdn/ (n. 负担) of that choice weighed on her, but she knew it was the **right** thing. Her **earnings** /ˈɜːrnɪŋz/ (n. 收入) had dropped, but her sense of purpose had grown.

"**Your** /jʊr/ (pron. 你的) work here is important," said Father Miguel, the local priest. He gestured toward the mountains. "Many people here suffer from **infections** /ɪnˈfekʃnz/ (n. 感染), and their **immune** /ɪˈmjuːn/ (adj. 免疫的) systems are weak. The **majority** /məˈdʒɔːrəti/ (n. 多数) of families can't afford **medicine**."

Sarah nodded. She had brought basic supplies—**paper** /ˈpeɪpər/ (n. 纸) for records, **cards** /kɑːrdz/ (n. 卡片) for patient files, and a **tube** /tuːb/ (n. 管子) of essential medicines. The government had **forbidden** /fərˈbɪdn/ (v. 禁止) certain treatments without a **patent** /ˈpætnt/ (n. 专利), but Sarah found ways to work within the system. "I'll do what I can," she said. "**Since** /sɪns/ (conj. 自从) I arrived, I've seen **changing** /ˈtʃeɪndʒɪŋ/ (adj. 变化的) attitudes. People are starting to trust **modern** medicine."

The clinic operated in a **division** /dɪˈvɪʒn/ (n. 分区) of an old church. Each morning, Sarah would **approach** /əˈproʊtʃ/ (v. 接近) the door and see families waiting. One day, a mother brought her daughter, who had a **disability** /ˌdɪsəˈbɪləti/ (n. 残疾) that made walking difficult. "**Should** /ʃʊd/ (modal v. 应该) I give up hope?" the mother asked, tears in her eyes.

Sarah knelt down and took the child's hand. "Never," she said softly. She pulled out a **scripture** /ˈskrɪptʃər/ (n. 经文) **card** that Father Miguel had given her. "This says, 'Where there is life, there is hope.' I can't promise miracles, but I can **grasp** /ɡræsp/ (v. 抓住) every chance to help **your** daughter improve."

Over months, the **combined** /kəmˈbaɪnd/ (adj. 联合的) efforts of the clinic and community brought change. They taught hygiene to prevent **infection**, protected **wildlife** /ˈwaɪldlaɪf/ (n. 野生动物) that carried disease, and gave practical health **tips** /tɪps/ (n. 建议). Sarah kept careful records on **paper**, noting each small victory. At the **bottom** of one page, she wrote: "Healing is not about **earnings** or **patents**—it's about presence."

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

莎拉·陈医生站在山谷的底部,那里有一个小诊所为一群村庄服务。她离开了城市医院的官方职位来这里工作。这个选择的负担压在她身上,但她知道这是正确的事情。她的收入下降了,但她的使命感增强了。

"你在这里的工作很重要,"当地的米格尔神父说。他朝山脉做了个手势。"这里许多人患有感染,他们的免疫系统很弱。大多数家庭买不起药。"

莎拉点了点头。她带来了基本物资——记录用的纸、病人档案用的卡片,以及一管必需的药品。政府已经禁止了某些没有专利的治疗方法,但莎拉找到了在系统内工作的方法。"我会尽我所能,"她说。"自从我到达以来,我看到了变化的态度。人们开始信任现代医学。"

诊所在一座老教堂的一个分区里运营。每天早上,莎拉走近门口都会看到等待的家庭。有一天,一位母亲带来了她的女儿,她有残疾,走路很困难。"我应该放弃希望吗?"母亲问道,眼中含泪。

莎拉跪下来,握住孩子的手。"永远不要,"她轻声说。她拿出米格尔神父给她的一张经文卡片。"这上面说,'有生命的地方就有希望。'我不能保证奇迹,但我可以抓住每一个机会来帮助你的女儿改善。"

几个月来,诊所和社区的联合努力带来了变化。他们教授卫生知识以预防感染,保护携带疾病的野生动物,并给予实用的健康建议。莎拉在纸上认真记录,记录每一个小小的胜利。在一页的底部,她写道:"治愈不是关于收入或专利——而是关于在场。"

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "weigh on" 的用法

**原句:** "The burden of that choice weighed on her, but she knew it was the right thing."

**聚焦:** 动词短语 "weigh on"

**用法说明:** 
"weigh on someone" 是一个常用的动词短语,意为"使某人担忧、压在某人心头"。这里的 "weigh" 不是字面的"称重",而是比喻性地表示心理压力。类似的表达还有 "weigh on one's mind"。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: The burden of that choice
- 谓语短语: weighed on
- 宾语: her
- 比喻意义: 选择的负担像重物一样压在她心上

**类似表达:**
- The problem weighs heavily on my mind. (问题困扰着我)
- Guilt weighed on his conscience. (内疚感折磨着他的良心)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 情态动词 should 的用法

**原句:** "Should I give up hope?"

**聚焦:** 情态动词 should 表示征求意见

**用法说明:**
Should 除了表示"应该"(义务、建议)外,在疑问句中还可以用来征求意见或建议,相当于 "Do you think I should...?"。这种用法在口语中很常见,语气比较委婉。

**should 的主要用法:**
1. 表示义务/建议: You should see a doctor. (你应该看医生)
2. 表示推测: He should be home by now. (他现在应该到家了)
3. 征求意见: Should I tell him? (我应该告诉他吗?)
4. 虚拟语气: If you should see him, tell him to call me. (万一你见到他,叫他给我打电话)

**可替换句:** "Do you think I should give up hope?" 或 "Ought I to give up hope?" (更正式)
