## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

**Thursday** /ˈθɜːrzdeɪ/ (n. 星期四) morning arrived with a **sweep** /swiːp/ (n./v. 扫除；横扫) of cold wind. Marcus, a data **analyst** /ˈænəlɪst/ (n. 分析师), stood in his office, watching numbers flash across the **screen** /skriːn/ (n. 屏幕). His team had been hired to **practice** /ˈpræktɪs/ (v./n. 实践；练习) new methods that would **impact** /ˈɪmpækt/ (v./n. 影响) the entire **city** /ˈsɪti/ (n. 城市). They were **considering** /kənˈsɪdərɪŋ/ (v. 考虑) how to **retain** /rɪˈteɪn/ (v. 保留；留住) clean water for the growing population.

"We need to make **sense** /sens/ (n./v. 意义；感知) of this data," said his **assistant** /əˈsɪstənt/ (n. 助手), Claire. She pointed to a chart showing water **coverage** /ˈkʌvərɪdʒ/ (n. 覆盖范围) across different areas. The **challenge** /ˈtʃælɪndʒ/ (n./v. 挑战) was clear: old pipes were **dirty** /ˈdɜːrti/ (adj. 脏的), and repairs would cost every **cent** /sent/ (n. 分；一美分) from the budget. Marcus felt the weight of this **absolute** /ˈæbsəluːt/ (adj. 绝对的) responsibility.

As they worked, Marcus began to see a **path** /pæθ/ (n. 道路；路径) forward. The solution lay not in one big fix but in small steps **apart** /əˈpɑːrt/ (adv./adj. 分开地). He planned a **trip** /trɪp/ (n. 旅行) to visit a nearby treatment plant to **mark** /mɑːrk/ (v./n. 标记；注意) what worked well there. "**I am** /aɪ æm/ (我是) sure we can learn from them," he told Claire.

At the plant, they met Dr. Lin, who explained her **promise** /ˈprɑːmɪs/ (n./v. 承诺) to the community: clean water for every home. She took them on a **boat** /boʊt/ (n. 船) along the river to show how they used natural systems. "Our **planet** /ˈplænɪt/ (n. 星球；地球) has its own wisdom," she said. "We just need to listen." Her approach held true **value** /ˈvæljuː/ (n./v. 价值).

Back at the office, Marcus wrote his report. The answer was not in expensive technology but in working with nature. The **coverage** would improve, and the **city** could finally **retain** water in a way that respected the **planet**. Sometimes the best solutions come from seeing the **sense** in what already works.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

星期四的早晨伴随着一阵冷风横扫而来。马库斯是一位数据分析师，他站在办公室里，看着屏幕上闪烁的数字。他的团队被雇佣来实践新方法，这些方法将影响整个城市。他们正在考虑如何为不断增长的人口保留清洁的水源。

"我们需要理解这些数据的意义，"他的助手克莱尔说。她指着一张显示不同地区水覆盖范围的图表。挑战很明显：旧管道很脏，而维修将花费预算中的每一分钱。马库斯感受到这份绝对责任的重量。

在工作过程中，马库斯开始看到一条前进的道路。解决方案不在于一个大修复，而在于分开的小步骤。他计划了一次旅行，去参观附近的处理厂，标记那里运作良好的地方。"我确信我们可以从他们那里学习，"他对克莱尔说。

在处理厂，他们遇到了林博士，她解释了她对社区的承诺：为每个家庭提供清洁的水。她带他们乘船沿着河流，展示他们如何使用自然系统。"我们的星球有自己的智慧，"她说。"我们只需要倾听。"她的方法具有真正的价值。

回到办公室后，马库斯写下了他的报告。答案不在于昂贵的技术，而在于与自然合作。覆盖范围将得到改善，城市最终能够以尊重地球的方式保留水资源。有时候，最好的解决方案来自于看到已经有效的事物的意义。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子1
**原句：** "They were considering how to retain clean water for the growing population."

**分析：** 这是一个典型的现在进行时态（were considering）与疑问词引导的宾语从句（how to retain...）的结合。"how to do something"结构简洁地表达了"如何做某事"的意思，常用于表示方法或途径。

**亮点：** "growing population"使用现在分词作定语，生动地描绘了人口持续增长的状态，比"large population"更有动态感。

---

### 句子2
**原句：** "The solution lay not in one big fix but in small steps apart."

**分析：** 这句使用了"not...but..."的对比结构，强调真正的解决方案所在。动词"lay"是"lie"的过去式，表示"位于，在于"。

**亮点：** "small steps apart"用"apart"强调了步骤的独立性和分散性，传达了化整为零的策略思想。这种表达比简单说"small steps"更有层次。

---

### 句子3
**原句：** "Our planet has its own wisdom," she said. "We just need to listen."

**分析：** 这是直接引语，包含拟人修辞。将"planet"赋予"wisdom"（智慧），使抽象的环保理念变得具体可感。第二句使用"just"强调行动的简单性。

**亮点：** 短句"We just need to listen"简洁有力，与前面较长的句子形成节奏对比，强化了核心信息。

---

### 句子4
**原句：** "The answer was not in expensive technology but in working with nature."

**分析：** 再次使用"not...but..."结构，清晰地对比两种解决思路。"in working with"使用动名词形式，表示持续的行动方式。

**亮点：** "working with nature"（与自然合作）比"using nature"（利用自然）更体现尊重和共生的理念，词汇选择体现价值观。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦1：过去进行时 (Past Continuous Tense)

**原句：** "They were considering how to retain clean water for the growing population."

**聚焦：** 过去进行时（were + V-ing）

**用法：** 过去进行时表示过去某个时间点正在进行的动作或持续的状态。在叙事中，它常用来设置背景或描述场景。这里"were considering"表明思考是一个持续的过程，不是瞬间的决定。

**可替换句：** "They thought about how to keep clean water for the growing population."（用一般过去时，但失去了"持续思考"的动态感）

---

### 聚焦2：Not...but...对比结构

**原句：** "The solution lay not in one big fix but in small steps apart."

**聚焦：** "not...but..."（不是...而是...）对比结构

**用法：** 这是英语中常用的对比强调句式，用来明确否定一种情况，同时肯定另一种情况。它比简单地说"The solution was in small steps"更有说服力，因为它主动排除了错误选项。

**语序特点：** "not"紧跟在动词后面，"but"引出真正的答案。

**可替换句：** "The solution was in small steps apart, not in one big fix."（调换顺序，but改为not，语气稍弱）

Write a short paragraph (80-100 words) about a time when you discovered that a simple solution worked better than a complicated one. Use at least 5 words from this group's vocabulary list.

**参考示例：**
Last month, I was considering how to improve my study habits. I tried many expensive apps and complicated schedules, but nothing seemed to work. Then my assistant teacher gave me simple advice: practice a little bit every day. This approach had a real impact on my learning. Now I retain information much better. Sometimes the path to success is simpler than we think, and we just need to find the sense in basic methods.
