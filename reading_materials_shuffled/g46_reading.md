## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **orange** /ˈɔːrɪndʒ/ (adj. 橙色的) **sky** /skaɪ/ (n. 天空) glowed as Dr. Maya Chen checked her phone. A **message** /ˈmesɪdʒ/ (n. 消息) had arrived from the **founder** /ˈfaʊndər/ (n. 创始人) of a tech startup: "We need your help. **Accept** /əkˈsept/ (v. 接受) this challenge?" She had been offered a **salary** /ˈsæləri/ (n. 薪水) far above her current one. But the work would require **maximum** /ˈmæksɪməm/ (adj. 最大的) **energy** /ˈenərdʒi/ (n. 精力).

Maya was **excited** /ɪkˈsaɪtɪd/ (adj. 兴奋的) but also nervous. **During** /ˈdʊrɪŋ/ (prep. 在...期间) her career, she had learned that **its** /ɪts/ (pron. 它的) value wasn't just in the money—**it** /ɪt/ (pron. 它) was about making a difference. The project involved creating an AI system to detect workplace **harassment** /həˈræsmənt/ (n. 骚扰). The technology needed to be **accurate** /ˈækjərət/ (adj. 准确的), **except** /ɪkˈsept/ (prep. 除了) when privacy was at **reserve** /rɪˈzɜːrv/ (n. 保护区).

"I can do this," Maya whispered, pressing her **thumb** /θʌm/ (n. 拇指) against the screen to confirm. She knew some might see AI as **evil** /ˈiːvl/ (adj. 邪恶的), but she believed **it** could be a force for good. She would **exchange** /ɪksˈtʃeɪndʒ/ (v. 交换) her comfortable research job for this uncertain path.

At the startup office, the team worked **rapidly** /ˈræpɪdli/ (adv. 快速地). **Instantly** /ˈɪnstəntli/ (adv. 立即), Maya felt at home. The founder, Jin, cut fruit with a **knife** /naɪf/ (n. 刀), offering pieces to everyone. "We work hard, but we eat well," he said with a smile. Maya could **readily** /ˈredɪli/ (adv. 容易地) see why people loved this place.

The first **demo** failed. The AI flagged **naturally** /ˈnætʃrəli/ (adv. 自然地) friendly conversation as harassment. Maya's phone began to **ring** /rɪŋ/ (v. 响铃) with complaints. But she refused to give up. She worked through the night, adjusting the system until **it** could understand context better. By dawn, they had **it**—a tool that was both **accurate** and respectful of human complexity.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

橙色的天空发光时,陈玛雅博士查看了她的手机。一条消息从一家科技创业公司的创始人那里到达:"我们需要你的帮助。接受这个挑战吗?"她被提供的薪水远高于她目前的薪水。但这项工作将需要最大的精力。

玛雅很兴奋但也很紧张。在她的职业生涯中,她了解到它的价值不仅仅在于金钱——它是关于产生影响。该项目涉及创建一个AI系统来检测工作场所骚扰。该技术需要准确,除了涉及隐私保护时。

"我能做到,"玛雅低声说,用拇指按屏幕确认。她知道有些人可能会把AI视为邪恶的,但她相信它可以成为一种向善的力量。她将交换她舒适的研究工作来走这条不确定的道路。

在创业公司办公室,团队快速工作。立即,玛雅感到宾至如归。创始人金用刀切水果,给每个人提供块。"我们努力工作,但我们吃得好,"他笑着说。玛雅可以容易地看出为什么人们喜欢这个地方。

第一次演示失败了。AI将自然友好的对话标记为骚扰。玛雅的电话开始响起抱怨。但她拒绝放弃。她通宵工作,调整系统直到它能更好地理解上下文。到黎明时,他们有了它——一个既准确又尊重人类复杂性的工具。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "But the work would require maximum energy."

**分析:** "require" 后直接接名词作宾语。"maximum" 作形容词修饰 energy,强调所需精力的程度。Would 表示将来的情况,语气比 will 更委婉。

**亮点:** 简洁地表达工作的高要求,为后续的挑战做铺垫。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "She knew some might see AI as evil, but she believed it could be a force for good."

**分析:** "see...as..." 是固定搭配,表示"把...视为..."。转折词 but 引出对比观点。"a force for good" 是习语,表示"向善的力量"。

**亮点:** 对比结构展现了对技术的不同态度,体现人物的价值观。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Maya could readily see why people loved this place."

**分析:** "can see why..." 表示"能够理解为什么..."。副词 readily 强调理解的容易程度。Why 引导的名词性从句作 see 的宾语。

**亮点:** 用简单结构表达复杂的认知过程,自然流畅。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "By dawn, they had it—a tool that was both accurate and respectful of human complexity."

**分析:** "by + 时间" 表示"到...时候"。破折号引出同位语,解释 "it" 的内容。"both...and..." 连接两个并列形容词。

**亮点:** 结尾升华,用具体的工具特征概括团队的成就。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "see...as..." 结构

**原句:** "She knew some might see AI as evil."

**聚焦:** 动词短语 "see...as..."

**用法说明:** 
"see + 对象 + as + 名词/形容词" 表示"把...视为/看作..."。这是一个常用的认知动词结构,as 后面可以接名词或形容词。类似的结构还有 regard...as, view...as, consider...as 等。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: some (people)
- 谓语: might see
- 宾语: AI
- 宾语补足语: as evil

**类似表达:**
- They regard him as a hero. (他们把他视为英雄)
- I view this as an opportunity. (我把这看作机会)
- We consider it as important. (我们认为它很重要)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "by + 时间" 表示完成

**原句:** "By dawn, they had it."

**聚焦:** 时间介词 by 的用法

**用法说明:**
"by + 时间" 表示"到...时候为止(已经完成)",常与完成时态连用。它强调在某个时间点之前动作已经完成。注意与 "until" 的区别:"until" 强调动作持续到某时间,"by" 强调在某时间之前完成。

**时态搭配:**
- By tomorrow, I will have finished. (到明天我就完成了 - 将来完成时)
- By 9 PM, they had left. (到晚上9点他们已经离开了 - 过去完成时)
- By now, you should know. (到现在你应该知道了 - 现在完成时)

**对比:**
- By dawn (到黎明时已经...) vs. Until dawn (持续到黎明)
