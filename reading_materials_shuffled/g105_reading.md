**#TechAndFuture** – A story of adaptation and discovery

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

In a small **factory** /ˈfæktəri/ (n. 工厂) on the edge of town, **where** /wer/ (adv./conj. 在哪里;在...的地方) old machines hummed alongside **programming** /ˈproʊɡræmɪŋ/ (n. 编程;程序设计) computers, Maria worked as a systems analyst. Her job was to help transition the traditional manufacturing plant into a modern, **database** /ˈdeɪtəbeɪs/ (n. 数据库)-driven operation. The task caused her constant **stress** /stres/ (n./v. 压力;强调), but she believed in the mission.

Maria had grown up in a **spanish** /ˈspænɪʃ/ (adj. 西班牙的;西班牙语的)-speaking household, and her parents had worked in factories all their lives. They understood the **common** /ˈkɑːmən/ (adj. 常见的;共同的) fear among workers: that technology would replace them. "**We** /wiː/ (pron. 我们) need to show them," Maria told her manager, "that technology is a tool, not a threat."

The **decline** /dɪˈklaɪn/ (n./v. 下降;衰退) in traditional manufacturing jobs was real, but Maria saw an opportunity **instead** /ɪnˈsted/ (adv. 代替;反而) of just problems. She wanted to **introduce** /ˌɪntrəˈduːs/ (v. 介绍;引进) training programs that would help workers learn new skills. **Eight** /eɪt/ (num. 八) months into the project, she organized her first workshop.

"Good morning, **we**'re here to learn something **new**," she began, addressing a room full of nervous faces. Among them was Carlos, a fifty-year-old machine operator who looked particularly uncomfortable. "I've worked with my hands for thirty years," he said. "I don't know anything about computers. This **et** /et/ (conj. 和;以及) cetera stuff is **foreign** /ˈfɔːrɪn/ (adj. 外国的;陌生的) to me."

Maria smiled warmly. "That's exactly why I'm here. **We**'re going to take this step by step. Think of a **database** like a filing cabinet, but faster. **Programming** is just giving instructions, like following a recipe." She pulled out her lunch—a slice of **pizza** /ˈpiːtsə/ (n. 比萨饼) she'd ordered earlier. "See this **pizza**? Someone had to create a recipe, right? That's like **programming**. And keeping track of ingredients? That's a **database**."

The analogy worked. People laughed, and the tension eased. Over the next few weeks, Maria **introduce**d them to basic computer skills. She taught them **where** to find information, how to input data, and why this mattered for their jobs. The **treatment** /ˈtriːtmənt/ (n. 治疗;对待) of workers during this transition was crucial—she made sure no one felt left behind.

But challenges remained. The **factory** was old, and implementing new systems everywhere required patience. Some equipment was so outdated that it couldn't connect to modern networks. Workers would **diagnose** /ˌdaɪəɡˈnoʊs/ (v. 诊断;判断) mechanical problems on machines covered in **dirt** /dɜːrt/ (n. 污垢;泥土), then struggle to enter that information into clean **database**s.

One afternoon, Carlos approached Maria with a problem. "The computer won't let me enter the information," he said, frustrated. Maria looked at his screen. "You're putting the data in the wrong field. See **where** it says 'Date'? That needs to be **separate** /ˈseprət/ (adj./v. 分开的;使分离) from the description." She showed him patiently, and he tried again. This time, it worked.

"**We**'ll get there," Maria assured him. "Learning takes time. **Instead** of thinking 'I can't do this,' try thinking 'I can't do this **yet**.'" Carlos nodded, a small smile forming. That single **word**—"yet"—made all the difference.

By the **eight**h month, something remarkable happened. Carlos not only mastered the basic systems but began **help**ing others. He'd keep a small notebook in his **pocket** /ˈpɑːkɪt/ (n. 口袋), writing down shortcuts and tips. "This is my personal **album** /ˈælbəm/ (n. 相册;专辑) of knowledge," he joked. The transformation was inspiring.

The **influence** /ˈɪnfluəns/ (n./v. 影响;作用) of Maria's approach spread beyond just technical skills. Workers began to see **foreign** technology not as an enemy but as an ally. They realized that **instead** of fearing change, they could shape it. The **factory** didn't just survive—it began to thrive.

During a company-wide **meeting**, the CEO announced that production efficiency had increased while maintaining all current positions. "This success," he said, "shows that **common** ground exists between tradition and innovation. And it's thanks to people like Maria and Carlos who believed **we** could do it."

Maria felt pride mixed with relief. The **stress** of the past months melted away. After the **meeting**, she found Carlos outside, looking thoughtful. "What are you thinking about?" she asked. "My granddaughter," he replied. "She wants to study **programming**. **Before** /bɪˈfɔːr/ (prep./conj. 在...之前), I couldn't understand why. Now, I do. I can even help her."

That evening, Maria walked through the **factory** one last time **before** heading home. The old machines and new computers worked in harmony, just as she'd envisioned. She thought about her parents, who had spent their lives in places like this. They'd worked hard so she could have opportunities they never had. Now, she'd used those opportunities to help others like them.

The next day, Maria **introduce**d a new idea: a mentorship program **where** experienced workers would teach new employees not just technical skills but also the history and values of the workplace. Carlos volunteered immediately. "I want to make sure young people understand that every job has dignity," he said. "Whether you're working with **dirt** under your nails or data on a screen."

Maria nodded, knowing they'd built something sustainable. The **factory** had transformed, but more importantly, so had the people within it. They'd learned that change doesn't mean losing who you are—it means discovering who you can become.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

在小镇边缘的一家小工厂里,在老机器与编程计算机并排运转的地方,玛丽亚担任系统分析师。她的工作是帮助传统制造工厂转型为现代化的、数据库驱动的运营。这项任务给她带来持续的压力,但她相信这个使命。

玛丽亚在一个说西班牙语的家庭长大,她的父母一生都在工厂工作。他们理解工人们共同的恐惧:技术会取代他们。"我们需要向他们展示,"玛丽亚告诉她的经理,"技术是工具,而不是威胁。"

传统制造业工作的下降是真实的,但玛丽亚看到的是机会而不仅仅是问题。她想引进培训计划,帮助工人学习新技能。项目进行到第八个月时,她组织了第一次研讨会。

"早上好,我们在这里学习新东西,"她开始说,面对一屋子紧张的面孔。其中有卡洛斯,一位五十岁的机器操作员,看起来特别不舒服。"我用手工作了三十年,"他说。"我对电脑一无所知。这些等等的东西对我来说是陌生的。"

玛丽亚热情地微笑。"这正是我在这里的原因。我们会一步一步来。把数据库想象成一个档案柜,但更快。编程就是给出指令,就像遵循食谱一样。"她拿出午餐——一片她早些时候点的比萨。"看到这个比萨了吗?有人必须创建食谱,对吧?这就像编程。跟踪配料?这就是数据库。"

这个类比奏效了。人们笑了,紧张缓解了。在接下来的几周里,玛丽亚向他们介绍了基本的计算机技能。她教他们在哪里找到信息,如何输入数据,以及为什么这对他们的工作很重要。在这次转型期间对工人的对待至关重要——她确保没有人感到被遗弃。

但挑战依然存在。工厂很旧,到处实施新系统需要耐心。一些设备太过时了,无法连接到现代网络。工人们会在沾满污垢的机器上诊断机械问题,然后努力将信息输入干净的数据库。

一天下午,卡洛斯带着一个问题找到玛丽亚。"电脑不让我输入信息,"他沮丧地说。玛丽亚看了看他的屏幕。"你把数据放错字段了。看到写着'日期'的地方了吗?那需要与描述分开。"她耐心地演示,他又试了一次。这次成功了。

"我们会成功的,"玛丽亚向他保证。"学习需要时间。不要想'我做不到',试着想'我还做不到'。"卡洛斯点头,露出了一丝微笑。那个词——"还"——产生了所有的不同。

到第八个月时,发生了非凡的事情。卡洛斯不仅掌握了基本系统,还开始帮助其他人。他会在口袋里放一个小笔记本,写下快捷方式和技巧。"这是我的个人知识专辑,"他开玩笑说。这种转变令人鼓舞。

玛丽亚方法的影响超越了技术技能。工人们开始将陌生的技术视为盟友而不是敌人。他们意识到,不要害怕变化,而是可以塑造它。工厂不仅生存下来——还开始蓬勃发展。

在全公司会议上,首席执行官宣布生产效率提高了,同时保持了所有现有职位。"这一成功,"他说,"表明传统与创新之间存在共同点。这要感谢玛丽亚和卡洛斯这样相信我们能做到的人。"

玛丽亚感到自豪与宽慰并存。过去几个月的压力消失了。会议结束后,她发现卡洛斯在外面,看起来若有所思。"你在想什么?"她问。"我的孙女,"他回答。"她想学习编程。以前,我无法理解为什么。现在,我明白了。我甚至可以帮助她。"

那天晚上,在回家之前,玛丽亚最后一次走过工厂。旧机器和新电脑和谐工作,正如她所设想的那样。她想起了她的父母,他们一生都在这样的地方度过。他们努力工作,让她有了他们从未有过的机会。现在,她用这些机会帮助了像他们一样的人。

第二天,玛丽亚提出了一个新想法:一个导师计划,经验丰富的工人将向新员工传授不仅是技术技能,还有工作场所的历史和价值观。卡洛斯立即自愿参加。"我想确保年轻人理解每份工作都有尊严,"他说。"无论你是手指甲下有污垢还是屏幕上有数据。"

玛丽亚点头,知道他们建立了可持续的东西。工厂转型了,但更重要的是,里面的人也转型了。他们了解到,改变不意味着失去自己——而是发现你可以成为谁。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "They understood the common fear among workers: that technology would replace them."

**分析:** 冒号后的 "that" 引导同位语从句,解释 "fear" 的具体内容。"among workers" 是介词短语作后置定语修饰 "fear"。

**亮点:** 同位语从句是说明抽象名词内容的有效方式,常用于正式写作。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Instead of thinking 'I can't do this,' try thinking 'I can't do this yet.'"

**分析:** "instead of doing" 结构表示"代替做某事"。两个引号内的内容形成对比,仅一个词"yet"的差异传达了成长心态的重要性。

**亮点:** 通过最小化的文字改变传达深刻的心理学概念,是优秀教学语言的典范。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Whether you're working with dirt under your nails or data on a screen."

**分析:** "whether...or..." 结构表示"无论是...还是...",强调两种情况的平等性。"with + 名词 + 介词短语" 描述工作状态。

**亮点:** 这个对比巧妙地将体力劳动和脑力劳动并列,传达了工作尊严的理念。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "They'd learned that change doesn't mean losing who you are—it means discovering who you can become."

**分析:** "that" 引导宾语从句。破折号连接两个平行结构,通过 "losing" 和 "discovering" 的对比升华主题。"who you are/can become" 是名词性从句作宾语。

**亮点:** 这个结尾句深刻地重新定义了"改变",给读者留下思考和鼓舞。
