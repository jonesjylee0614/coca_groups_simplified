**#SliceOfLife** – A story of new beginnings and discovery

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Sarah stood in the empty apartment, her **head** /hed/ (n. 头;头脑) spinning with possibilities. The space was **total**ly /ˈtoʊtəli/ (adv. 完全地) bare—no **furniture** /ˈfɜːrnɪtʃər/ (n. 家具), no decorations, just white walls and wooden floors. Her **background** /ˈbækɡraʊnd/ (n. 背景;经历) in interior design told her this was a blank canvas, but her anxious mind worried about the **rapid** /ˈræpɪd/ (adj. 快速的;迅速的) timeline she faced.

"**Well** /wel/ (adv./interj. 好;嗯)," she said to herself, trying to sound confident, "I guess it's time to **meet** /miːt/ (v. 遇见;满足) this challenge **head**-on." She had exactly two weeks to transform this space into a showroom before the **poll** /poʊl/ (n. 民意调查;投票) of potential clients would **depend** /dɪˈpend/ (v. 依靠;取决于) on her work to decide whether to hire her firm.

Sarah pulled out her tablet to **update** /ˈʌpdeɪt/ (v. 更新; n. 最新消息) her design plans. She had been a **traveler** /ˈtrævələr/ (n. 旅行者) for years, collecting ideas from different cultures. Now, those experiences would **submit** /səbˈmɪt/ (v. 提交;服从) to practical application. The apartment's owners wanted something **cool** /kuːl/ (adj. 凉爽的;酷的) yet **reliable** /rɪˈlaɪəbl/ (adj. 可靠的;可信赖的), modern but not **offensive** /əˈfensɪv/ (adj. 冒犯的;进攻的).

As she measured the space, a **stone** /stoʊn/ (n. 石头;宝石) paperweight slipped from her bag. It was a gift from her grandmother, who had always told her: "Build your dreams on a solid foundation, like a house on **stone**." Sarah picked it up, feeling its weight. She had to **acknowledge** /əkˈnɑːlɪdʒ/ (v. 承认;感谢) that this project felt different—more personal somehow.

The next day, Sarah began her work. She had contacted a **reliable** carpenter to build custom shelving. The **product** /ˈprɑːdʌkt/ (n. 产品;成果) he delivered was exactly what she needed. She also installed a vintage **pump** /pʌmp/ (n. 泵; v. 打气) handle as a decorative piece—an **odd** /ɑːd/ (adj. 奇怪的;单数的) choice that somehow worked perfectly.

The walls needed attention. Sarah chose a **partial** /ˈpɑːrʃl/ (adj. 部分的;偏袒的) accent wall in deep blue, which created visual interest without overwhelming the space. She positioned a comfortable reading chair near the window, where natural light would **pump** energy into the room. The **furniture** she selected was minimalist but warm—a careful balance.

On the final day, as she made last-minute adjustments, the building superintendent stopped by. "You're going to **win** /wɪn/ (v. 赢得;获胜) them over," he said, nodding approvingly. "This place has good bones, and you've made them shine."

Sarah smiled, placing fresh flowers on the dining table. She had managed to create something that felt both **healthy** /ˈhelθi/ (adj. 健康的;有益的) and sophisticated. The apartment now told a story—one that would hopefully **meet** the clients' expectations and prove the **validity** /vəˈlɪdəti/ (n. 有效性;正确性) of her design philosophy.

When the clients arrived for the **poll**, Sarah watched their faces carefully. They walked through silently at first, then began pointing and discussing. "This is **totally** what we envisioned," the wife finally said. "The **background** you've created makes every piece of **furniture** feel intentional. And that **stone** accent piece? **Cool**."

The husband ran his hand along the custom shelving. "We **depend** on designers to understand our vision, but you've exceeded it. The **product** you've delivered is **reliable** and beautiful. We want to **arrest** /əˈrest/ (v. 逮捕;阻止; n. 逮捕) this moment—it's perfect as is. We'd like to hire your firm for our entire **product** line of properties."

Sarah felt her heart soar. She had taken a **rapid** timeline and an empty space and created something meaningful. Her **head** was no longer spinning—instead, it was filled with gratitude and new ideas. As she walked out into the **cool** evening air, Sarah realized that sometimes the most important thing isn't having all the answers but being willing to **submit** yourself fully to the creative process.

She **updated** her portfolio that night, adding photos of the space. Each image was a reminder that with dedication and vision, an empty room could become a home, and a challenge could become a triumph.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

莎拉站在空荡荡的公寓里,脑袋里充满了各种可能性。这个空间完全是空的——没有家具,没有装饰,只有白墙和木地板。她在室内设计方面的背景告诉她,这是一张白纸,但她焦虑的心智担心她面临的快速时间表。

"好吧,"她对自己说,试图听起来自信,"我想是时候正面迎接这个挑战了。"她只有两周时间将这个空间改造成一个展示厅,之后潜在客户的投票将取决于她的工作来决定是否聘用她的公司。

莎拉拿出她的平板电脑更新她的设计计划。她多年来一直是个旅行者,从不同的文化中收集想法。现在,这些经历将服从于实际应用。公寓的业主想要既酷又可靠、现代但不冒犯的东西。

当她测量空间时,一个石头镇纸从她的包里滑落。这是她祖母送的礼物,祖母总是告诉她:"把你的梦想建立在坚实的基础上,就像房子建在石头上。"莎拉捡起它,感受它的重量。她必须承认这个项目感觉不同——不知为何更私人一些。

第二天,莎拉开始了她的工作。她联系了一位可靠的木匠来建造定制货架。他交付的产品正是她所需要的。她还安装了一个老式的泵把手作为装饰品——一个奇怪的选择,但不知何故完美地配合了。

墙壁需要关注。莎拉选择了深蓝色的部分重点墙,在不压倒空间的情况下创造了视觉趣味。她在窗边放置了一把舒适的阅读椅,自然光会为房间注入能量。她选择的家具简约但温暖——一个精心的平衡。

最后一天,当她做最后的调整时,大楼管理员停下来看看。"你会赢得他们的心,"他赞许地点点头说。"这个地方骨架好,你让它们闪闪发光。"

莎拉微笑着,在餐桌上放了新鲜的花。她成功地创造了既健康又精致的东西。公寓现在讲述了一个故事——一个希望能满足客户期望并证明她设计理念有效性的故事。

当客户到达进行投票时,莎拉仔细观察他们的脸。他们起初安静地走过,然后开始指点和讨论。"这完全是我们设想的,"妻子最后说。"你创造的背景让每一件家具都感觉有意图。还有那个石头装饰品?太酷了。"

丈夫用手抚摸着定制的货架。"我们依靠设计师来理解我们的愿景,但你超越了它。你交付的产品可靠而美丽。我们想要定格这一刻——它现在就很完美。我们想聘用你的公司来做我们整个产品线的房产。"

莎拉感到心在翱翔。她把一个快速的时间表和一个空旷的空间变成了有意义的东西。她的脑袋不再旋转——相反,它充满了感激和新想法。当她走进凉爽的傍晚空气中时,莎拉意识到有时最重要的不是拥有所有答案,而是愿意完全投入创造过程。

那天晚上她更新了她的作品集,添加了空间的照片。每张图片都提醒着,只要有奉献精神和愿景,一个空房间可以变成一个家,一个挑战可以变成一次胜利。

**原句:** "I guess it's time to meet this challenge head-on."

**分析:** "head-on" 是副词,意为"正面地;迎头"。"meet a challenge" 表示"迎接挑战"。这里使用了 "head" 的双关,既是身体部位,也构成习语 "head-on"。

**亮点:** 通过习语让表达更生动有力,传达了直面困难的决心。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Now, those experiences would submit to practical application."

**分析:** "submit to" 通常表示"服从;屈服",这里创造性地用于表示经验"被应用于"实践。这是一种拟人化的表达。

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Build your dreams on a solid foundation, like a house on stone."

**分析:** 这是一个明喻(simile),用 "like" 将抽象的"梦想"与具体的"建在石头上的房子"进行比较。这句话富有哲理性,是智慧的传递。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Sometimes the most important thing isn't having all the answers but being willing to submit yourself fully to the creative process."
