**#SliceOfLife** – A story of new beginnings

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **birthday** /ˈbɜːrθdeɪ/ (n. 生日) party was small but meaningful. Layla, a **refugee** /ˌrefjuˈdʒiː/ (n. 难民) from a war-torn country, stood in the community center surrounded by her **various** /ˈveriəs/ (adj. 各种各样的) neighbors. They had come to celebrate her first year in the city. On the table sat a simple **salad** /ˈsæləd/ (n. 沙拉), **free** /friː/ (adj. 免费的) for everyone, and a cake decorated with **markers** /ˈmɑːrkərz/ (n. 标记) of different colors—each one representing a person who had helped her.

"This is **extraordinary** /ɪkˈstrɔːrdəneri/ (adj. 非凡的)," Layla whispered, her eyes wet with tears. An elderly man named Chen, of **Asian** /ˈeɪʒn/ (adj. 亚洲的) descent, patted her shoulder. "You've come **last** /læst/ (adj. 最后的) in line, but you're **left** /left/ (v. 留下) with people who care. That's what matters."

Layla thought back to the **contest** /ˈkɑːntest/ (n. 比赛) she had entered **last** month—a cooking competition for **native** /ˈneɪtɪv/ (adj. 本地的) and immigrant cooks. She had been nervous, her hands shaking as she tried to **compose** /kəmˈpoʊz/ (v. 组成) a dish that honored her heritage. "I can't **drink** /drɪŋk/ (v. 喝) to this—I don't drink alcohol," she had joked to ease the tension. "But I can **dance** /dæns/ (v. 跳舞) if we win!"

They hadn't won, but the experience had **seized** /siːzd/ (v. 抓住) her imagination. Through **thinking** /ˈθɪŋkɪŋ/ (n. 思考) about food, she had found a **channel** /ˈtʃænl/ (n. 渠道) to connect with others. The **origin** /ˈɔːrɪdʒɪn/ (n. 起源) of her recipes told stories—stories of home, loss, and hope. "**His** /hɪz/ (pron. 他的) **cat** /kæt/ (n. 猫) even likes your cooking," Chen said, pointing to a small orange cat sitting nearby. Everyone laughed.

But **goddamn** /ˈɡɑːdˌdæm/ (interj. 该死的, note: mild expletive), Layla thought, life had been hard. When the war started, a **helicopter** /ˈhelɪkɑːptər/ (n. 直升机) had airlifted her family to safety, but they had **left** so much behind. Now, in this new place, she was learning to **seize** moments of **grace** /ɡreɪs/ (n. 优雅). "You have to **vote** /voʊt/ (v. 投票) in the next election," Chen said. "Be part of this place. Make it yours."

Layla nodded. She would. This was her **birthday** not just as another year older, but as a new **origin** story—one where she was **free** to build a life, one meal, one friend, one moment at a time.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

这个生日派对虽小但意义重大。来自战乱国家的难民蕾拉站在社区中心,被各种各样的邻居包围着。他们来庆祝她在这个城市的第一年。桌上放着一份简单的沙拉,对每个人都是免费的,还有一个用不同颜色的标记装饰的蛋糕——每一个都代表了帮助过她的人。

"这太非凡了,"蕾拉低语道,眼中含泪。一位名叫陈的老人,亚洲血统,拍了拍她的肩膀。"你排在最后,但你留下的是关心你的人。这才是重要的。"

蕾拉回想起上个月她参加的比赛——一个为本地和移民厨师举办的烹饪比赛。她很紧张,当她试图组成一道尊重她传统的菜肴时,她的手在颤抖。"我不能为此干杯——我不喝酒,"她开玩笑说以缓解紧张。"但如果我们赢了,我可以跳舞!"

他们没有赢,但这次经历抓住了她的想象力。通过思考食物,她找到了与他人联系的渠道。她食谱的起源讲述了故事——关于家、失去和希望的故事。"他的猫甚至喜欢你的烹饪,"陈说,指着附近坐着的一只小橙猫。每个人都笑了。

但该死的,蕾拉想,生活一直很艰难。当战争开始时,一架直升机将她的家人空运到安全地带,但他们留下了很多东西。现在,在这个新地方,她正在学习抓住优雅的时刻。"你必须在下次选举中投票,"陈说。"成为这个地方的一部分。让它成为你的。"

蕾拉点了点头。她会的。这是她的生日,不仅仅是又长大了一岁,而是一个新的起源故事——一个她可以自由地建立生活的故事,一顿饭,一个朋友,一次一个时刻。
