**#Adventure** – A story of courage and rescue

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **coach** /koʊtʃ/ (n. 教练) felt **uncomfortable** /ʌnˈkʌmftəbl/ (adj. 不舒服的) as the **airplane** /ˈerpleɪn/ (n. 飞机) shook. He was flying **through** /θruː/ (prep. 穿过) a storm to reach a small village. **Since** /sɪns/ (conj. 自从；因为) the earthquake, many people were **sick** /sɪk/ (adj. 生病的) and needed help. The **fund** /fʌnd/ (n. 基金) had finally come **through**, but there was a **limit** /ˈlɪmɪt/ (n. 限制) to what they could do.

"**Hey** /heɪ/ (interj. 嘿)," the pilot called out, "we need **permission** /pərˈmɪʃn/ (n. 许可) to land." The radio crackled. The coach looked **inside** /ɪnˈsaɪd/ (prep./adv. 在里面) his bag and checked the medicine. He had to be **successful** /səkˈsesfəl/ (adj. 成功的). Too many **human** /ˈhjuːmən/ (adj./n. 人类的；人) lives were at risk.

When they landed, the scene was terrible. Buildings had started to **collapse** /kəˈlæps/ (v. 倒塌). Smoke rose from a fire that threatened to **explode** /ɪkˈsploʊd/ (v. 爆炸) a gas tank. The coach didn't wait. He had to **commit** /kəˈmɪt/ (v. 承诺；投入) fully to the **rescue** /ˈreskjuː/ (n./v. 救援) work.

"**Tonight** /təˈnaɪt/ (n./adv. 今晚), we save lives," he said. The team moved quickly. They had to **grab** /ɡræb/ (v. 抓住) supplies and **modify** /ˈmɑːdɪfaɪ/ (v. 修改；调整) their plan. The original plan would not work here. **Automatically** /ɔːtəˈmætɪkli/ (adv. 自动地), the coach began giving orders.

In one tent, they found a woman from an **Arab** /ˈærəb/ (adj./n. 阿拉伯的；阿拉伯人) family. She was hurt but alive. The **green** /ɡriːn/ (adj. 绿色的) medical bag held what they needed. As the coach worked on her injured **hip** /hɪp/ (n. 臀部), he thought about the darkness humans face—natural disasters, violence, even **rape** /reɪp/ (n./v. 强奸) in conflict zones. But tonight, they would fight back with care and courage.

By morning, twenty people were safe. The rescue was **successful**. The coach sat down, tired but proud. He had kept his **commitment**.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

教练感到不舒服，飞机在颤抖。他正穿越暴风雨飞往一个小村庄。自从地震以来，许多人生病了，需要帮助。基金终于到位，但他们能做的有限制。

"嘿，"飞行员喊道，"我们需要许可才能降落。"无线电噼啪作响。教练看了看包里面，检查了药品。他必须成功。太多人类的生命处于危险之中。

当他们降落时，场面很可怕。建筑物已经开始倒塌。浓烟从一场大火中升起，威胁要引爆一个燃气罐。教练没有等待。他必须全力投入救援工作。

"今晚，我们拯救生命，"他说。团队快速行动。他们必须抓住补给品并调整计划。原来的计划在这里行不通。教练自动地开始发号施令。

在一个帐篷里，他们发现了一位来自阿拉伯家庭的妇女。她受伤了但还活着。绿色医疗包里有他们需要的东西。当教练处理她受伤的臀部时，他想到了人类面临的黑暗——自然灾害、暴力，甚至冲突地区的强奸。但今晚，他们将用关怀和勇气反击。

到早上，二十个人获救了。救援成功了。教练坐了下来，疲惫但自豪。他信守了承诺。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Since the earthquake, many people were sick and needed help."

**分析:** "Since" 作为时间状语从句的连接词，表示"自从...以来"。这个句子使用简单过去时 "were sick"，表示地震后的持续状态。"and" 连接两个并列的谓语 "were sick" 和 "needed help"。

**亮点:** Since 既可以表示时间（自从），也可以表示原因（因为），需要根据语境判断。这里是时间用法。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "He had to commit fully to the rescue work."

**分析:** "commit to" 是固定搭配，表示"承诺做某事；全力投入"。副词 "fully" 修饰动词 "commit"，强调程度。"have to" 表示必须，体现了责任感。

**亮点:** "commit to something" 是表达决心和责任的常用表达，在正式写作中很实用。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "They had to grab supplies and modify their plan."

**分析:** 两个并列的动词 "grab" 和 "modify" 共用同一个主语和助动词 "had to"，使句子简洁有力。这种并列结构在叙述行动时非常有效。

**亮点:** 动词的选择很精准："grab"（快速抓取）暗示紧急情况，"modify"（调整）显示灵活应变能力。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Automatically, the coach began giving orders."

**分析:** 副词 "automatically" 置于句首，强调教练的反应是本能的、训练有素的。"began giving orders" 使用动名词形式，比 "began to give" 更强调动作的连续性。

**亮点:** 副词前置是英语写作中创造强调效果的有效手段。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: Since 的双重用法

**原句:** "Since the earthquake, many people were sick and needed help."

**聚焦:** Since 作为时间连词的用法

**用法说明:**
"Since" 可以表示时间（自从）或原因（因为）。在这个句子中，"since the earthquake" 表示"自从地震以来"，引导时间状语。当 since 表示时间时，主句通常使用完成时态，但如果强调过去的状态，也可以使用过去时。

**时态搭配:**
- Since + 过去时间点，主句用现在完成时：I have lived here since 2020.
- Since + 过去时间点，主句用过去时（强调过去状态）：Since that day, he was a different person.

**可替换句:** "After the earthquake, many people became sick and needed help."

---

### 聚焦点 2: Have to 表示必要性

**原句:** "He had to commit fully to the rescue work."

**聚焦:** Have to 表示客观必要性

**用法说明:**
"Have to" 表示客观上的必须，强调外部环境或情况的要求。与 "must" 相比，"have to" 更强调外部压力，而 "must" 更多表示说话者的主观判断。

**结构分析:**
- 肯定句: have/has to + 动词原形
- 过去式: had to + 动词原形
- 否定句: don't/doesn't have to（表示不必）

**可替换句:** "He needed to commit fully to the rescue work." 或 "He must commit fully to the rescue work."（更主观）
