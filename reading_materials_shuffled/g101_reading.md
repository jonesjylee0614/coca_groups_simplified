**#MoralReflection** – A story of truth and integrity

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **hour** /aʊər/ (n. 小时;时刻) was late when Thomas, a **new** /nuː/ (adj. 新的;新鲜的) **lawmaker** /ˈlɔːmeɪkər/ (n. 立法者;议员), arrived at the **registration** /ˌredʒɪˈstreɪʃn/ (n. 登记;注册) desk. His campaign for the **presidency** /ˈprezɪdənsi/ (n. 总统职位;主席职位) had been built on one promise: no **FALSE** /fɔːls/ (adj. 错误的;虚假的) statements, no empty words. He believed every **effort** /ˈefərt/ (n. 努力;尝试) should be honest.

Inside the hall, **french** /frentʃ/ (adj. 法国的;法语的) diplomats mingled with local officials. A **bishop** /ˈbɪʃəp/ (n. 主教;(国际象棋)象) in traditional robes spoke about moral duty. Thomas felt the **warming** /ˈwɔːrmɪŋ/ (n./adj. 变暖;温暖的) atmosphere, but also sensed tension. The **estimated** /ˈestɪmeɪtɪd/ (adj. 估计的;预估的) attendance was twice what they'd planned for.

An **individual** /ˌɪndɪˈvɪdʒuəl/ (n./adj. 个人;个别的) approached him—a journalist known for tough questions. "Mr. Thomas, there's a **remark** /rɪˈmɑːrk/ (n./v. 评论;说起) spreading that your funding comes from oil companies. Care to comment?" Thomas felt his stomach **kick** /kɪk/ (v./n. 踢;踢腿). This was the moment that would define him.

He took a breath. "Let me be clear," he began. "That's a **FALSE** statement. My campaign is funded by **individual** citizens, not corporations. But I understand why you'd ask—there's been much **speculation** /ˌspekjuˈleɪʃn/ (n. 推测;猜测). Let me **resolve** /rɪˈzɑːlv/ (v./n. 解决;决心) this now." He pulled out documents, his hands steady despite the pressure.

The room fell silent. A woman at the back—wearing a scarf of **silk** /sɪlk/ (n. 丝绸;丝织品) dyed with **olive** /ˈɑːlɪv/ (n./adj. 橄榄;橄榄色的) green—stood up. "What about the water **tank** /tæŋk/ (n. 坦克;水箱) project you promised? Still a **joke** /dʒoʊk/ (n./v. 笑话;开玩笑)?" Her tone was sharp, not playful.

Thomas didn't flinch. "It's no **joke**. The project will **end** /end/ (v./n. 结束;终止) water shortages in three districts. We start **till** /tɪl/ (prep./conj. 直到) March, and continue **till** completion. I've **seal** /siːl/ (v./n. 密封;盖章) the agreement myself." He held up a document with an official **seal**.

The journalist pressed on: "Your opponent says you'll **dry** /draɪ/ (adj./v. 干的;使干) up funding for education. What's at **stake** /steɪk/ (n. 股份;赌注;利害关系)?" Thomas paused. This wasn't about winning anymore—it was about truth. "What's at **stake** is our children's future. I will not **fly** /flaɪ/ (v. 飞行;飞) away from difficult decisions. The **registration** numbers show education is our priority."

An elderly man raised his hand. "Son, politics isn't clean. Why not tell a small lie to win?" Thomas looked him in the eye. "Because one **FALSE** word leads to another. I'd rather lose with integrity than win with lies. That's not a **joke**—that's my **resolve**."

The crowd began to applaud. The bishop nodded approvingly. As Thomas left the stage, the woman in the **silk** scarf approached. "You've earned my vote," she said simply. "Not because of your **remark** about water, but because you didn't **kick** the tough questions away."

Thomas smiled. "Thank you. Every **individual** vote matters. Together, we can **end** the cycle of distrust." Walking out into the night, he felt lighter. Win or lose, he'd stayed true to himself—and that was enough.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

当托马斯——一位新任立法者——到达登记台时,已经是很晚的时刻了。他竞选总统职位的承诺只有一个:没有虚假陈述,没有空洞言辞。他相信每一份努力都应该是诚实的。

大厅里,法国外交官与当地官员混在一起。一位身穿传统长袍的主教谈论着道德责任。托马斯感受到温暖的氛围,但也察觉到紧张。预估的出席人数是他们计划的两倍。

一个人走近他——一位以提出尖锐问题而闻名的记者。"托马斯先生,有评论说您的资金来自石油公司。想评论一下吗?"托马斯感到胃部一阵紧缩。这是定义他的时刻。

他深吸一口气。"让我说清楚,"他开始说。"这是一个虚假陈述。我的竞选活动由个人公民资助,而不是公司。但我理解你为什么会问——已经有很多推测了。让我现在解决这个问题。"他拿出文件,尽管压力很大,他的手依然稳定。

房间陷入沉默。后面的一位女士——围着用橄榄绿染色的丝绸围巾——站了起来。"你承诺的水箱项目怎么样了?还是个笑话吗?"她的语气尖锐,并非开玩笑。

托马斯没有退缩。"这不是笑话。该项目将结束三个地区的缺水问题。我们从三月开始,一直持续到完成。我亲自盖章了这份协议。"他举起一份带有官方印章的文件。

记者继续追问:"你的对手说你会削减教育资金。什么处于危险之中?"托马斯停顿了一下。这不再是关于获胜——而是关于真理。"危险的是我们孩子的未来。我不会逃避困难的决定。登记数字显示教育是我们的优先事项。"

一位老人举手。"孩子,政治不干净。为什么不说个小谎来赢呢?"托马斯直视他的眼睛。"因为一个虚假的词会导致另一个。我宁愿带着诚信输掉,也不愿带着谎言赢得。这不是笑话——这是我的决心。"

人群开始鼓掌。主教赞许地点头。当托马斯离开舞台时,那位穿丝绸围巾的女士走近。"你赢得了我的一票,"她简单地说。"不是因为你关于水的评论,而是因为你没有回避难题。"

托马斯微笑着。"谢谢。每一个人的票都很重要。我们一起可以结束不信任的循环。"走进夜色,他感到轻松了。无论胜负,他都忠于自己——这就足够了。
