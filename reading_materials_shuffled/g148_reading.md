**#MoralReflection** – The Dragon's Census

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

"**Aah** /ɑː/ (interj. 啊)," sighed the **lieutenant** /luːˈtenənt/ (n. 中尉；副官), sitting at the wooden **table** /ˈteɪbl/ (n. 桌子). "This **census** /ˈsensəs/ (n. 人口普查) will take forever." He was **running** /ˈrʌnɪŋ/ (v. 跑；运行) the count for a remote mountain region where, **reportedly** /rɪˈpɔːrtɪdli/ (adv. 据报道), a **dragon** /ˈdræɡən/ (n. 龙) still lived. Most people thought it was just a **legend** /ˈledʒənd/ (n. 传说), **but** his job was to document every living creature.

The task seemed **ridiculous** /rɪˈdɪkjələs/ (adj. 荒谬的). How could he **enter** /ˈentər/ (v. 进入) data about something that might not **be** /biː/ (v. 是；存在) real? **Both** /boʊθ/ (det./pron. 两者都) his training and common sense told him to **seek** /siːk/ (v. 寻求；寻找) evidence first. Yet the villagers were **loyal** /ˈlɔɪəl/ (adj. 忠诚的) to their stories. One old woman, **gentle** /ˈdʒentl/ (adj. 温和的；轻柔的) **in** manner, insisted she'd seen the creature **blow** /bloʊ/ (v. 吹；刮) fire near the **grain** /ɡreɪn/ (n. 谷物；颗粒) storage last winter.

"**Like** /laɪk/ (prep./v./conj. 像；喜欢) it or not," his supervisor had said, "you need **sufficient** /səˈfɪʃnt/ (adj. 足够的；充分的) data. Don't **confuse** /kənˈfjuːz/ (v. 使困惑；混淆) **legend** with fact, **but** don't dismiss local knowledge either." The lieutenant tried to **utilize** /ˈjuːtəlaɪz/ (v. 利用；使用) **both** approaches.

One evening, while the wind threatened to **bend** /bend/ (v. 弯曲；使屈服) the trees, he heard a strange sound—a **cue** /kjuː/ (n. 提示；暗号) that something was near. A **kid** /kɪd/ (n. 小孩；v. 开玩笑) from the village ran up. "Come quick! The **dragon** is at the old **outlet** /ˈaʊtlet/ (n. 出口；发泄途径) by the river!"

The lieutenant grabbed his notebook and followed. What he saw made him gasp. There, **in** the moonlight, was a creature—not quite a **dragon** from stories, **but** a rare species of large lizard **reportedly** extinct. It was **seek** /siːk/ (v. 寻求)-ing **grain** that had spilled from damaged storage. The **unity** /ˈjuːnəti/ (n. 团结；统一) of **legend** and reality struck him.

He **enter** /ˈentər/ (v. 进入)-ed the data carefully. Sometimes what seems **like** **fantasy** /ˈfæntəsi/ (n. 幻想) holds truth. He thought of his late mother, who'd always said, "**Money** /ˈmʌni/ (n. 金钱) isn't everything—**understanding** /ˌʌndərˈstændɪŋ/ (n. 理解；谅解) is." Back at his **table**, he wrote a note for the **lawsuit** /ˈlɔːsuːt/ (n. 诉讼) against those who'd been destroying the habitat: "Protect what you don't fully understand."

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

"啊,"中尉叹息着,坐在木桌旁。"这次人口普查会永远进行下去。"他正在对一个偏远山区进行统计,据报道那里仍然住着一条龙。大多数人认为这只是个传说,但他的工作是记录每一种生物。

这个任务看起来很荒谬。他怎么能输入关于可能不存在的东西的数据呢?他的训练和常识都告诉他要先寻找证据。然而村民们忠于他们的故事。一位举止温和的老妇人坚持说她去年冬天在谷物储藏处附近看到那个生物喷火。

"无论你喜不喜欢,"他的主管说过,"你需要足够的数据。不要把传说和事实混淆,但也不要忽视当地知识。"中尉试图利用这两种方法。

一天晚上,当风威胁要让树木弯曲时,他听到了一个奇怪的声音——一个提示有东西在附近。一个村里的小孩跑了上来。"快来!龙在河边的旧出口那里!"

中尉抓起笔记本跟了上去。他看到的让他倒吸一口气。在月光下,有一个生物——不完全是故事中的龙,而是一种据报道已经灭绝的稀有大型蜥蜴。它正在寻找从损坏的储藏处洒出的谷物。传说与现实的统一让他震惊。

他仔细地输入数据。有时看起来像幻想的东西包含着真相。他想起了已故的母亲,她总是说:"金钱不是一切——理解才是。"回到桌旁,他为那些一直在破坏栖息地的人写了一份诉讼笔记:"保护你还不完全理解的东西。"

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Don't confuse legend with fact, but don't dismiss local knowledge either."

**分析:** "confuse A with B" 表示"把A和B混淆"。"either" 用在否定句末尾,表示"也(不)"。两个祈使句通过 "but" 连接,形成平衡的建议。

**亮点:** 这句话体现了科学态度和文化尊重的平衡——既要区分事实与传说,又不能忽视本土知识。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "What he saw made him gasp."

**分析:** "what" 引导名词性从句作主语,"make sb. do" 表示"使某人做某事"。这是感官和因果关系的典型表达。

**亮点:** 简洁有力,通过"gasp"(倒吸一口气)这个具体动作传达了强烈的惊讶情绪。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Sometimes what seems like fantasy holds truth."

**分析:** "what seems like..." 是名词性从句作主语,表示"看起来像...的东西"。"hold" 在这里表示"包含;持有"。

**亮点:** 这是故事的核心主题,用简单的结构表达了深刻的哲理——表象与真相的关系。

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Protect what you don't fully understand."

**分析:** "what" 引导名词性从句作宾语。"fully" 修饰 "understand",强调完全性。这是祈使句,语气坚定。

**亮点:** 这句话具有环保和科学双重意义——在完全了解之前,应该保护而非破坏,体现了预防原则。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "make sb. do" 使役动词结构

**原句:** "What he saw made him gasp."

**聚焦:** "make + 宾语 + 动词原形" 结构

**用法说明:**
"make" 作为使役动词,表示"使/让某人做某事"。注意后面的动词必须用原形(不带to的不定式)。这个结构表示一种强制或必然的因果关系。

**常见使役动词对比:**
- make sb. do (强制;使...): The news made me cry.
- let sb. do (允许): Let me help you.
- have sb. do (要求): I'll have him call you.

**被动语态:**
- 主动: The movie made me laugh.
- 被动: I was made to laugh. (注意:被动语态中要加 "to")

**可替换句:** "What he saw caused him to gasp." (使用 "cause" 时需要加 "to")

---

### 聚焦点 2: "what" 引导名词性从句

**原句:** "Sometimes what seems like fantasy holds truth."

**聚焦:** "what" 引导名词性从句

**用法说明:**
"what" 可以引导名词性从句,在从句中充当主语、宾语或表语。"what" = "the thing(s) that",意为"...的事物"。这种结构非常常用,可以使表达更简洁。

**例句:**
- What you said is true. (主语从句)
- I don't understand what he means. (宾语从句)
- This is what I want. (表语从句)

**对比:**
- 用 what: What she needs is rest. (简洁)
- 用 that: The thing that she needs is rest. (较繁琐)

**可替换句:** "Sometimes the things that seem like fantasy hold truth."
