**#TechAndFuture** – A story of innovation and family

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Maya touched her **sister's** /ˈsɪstərz/ (n. 姐妹的) **hair** /her/ (n. 头发) gently. Lina had been **sick** for months, receiving **radiation** /ˌreɪdiˈeɪʃn/ (n. 辐射；放射治疗) treatment **that** /ðæt/ (pron./conj. 那；那个) made her weak. "**Maybe** /ˈmeɪbi/ (adv. 也许；可能) science can help," Maya thought. She was a **leading** /ˈliːdɪŋ/ (adj. 领先的；主要的) engineer in **robot** /ˈroʊbɑːt/ (n. 机器人) design, but her work felt distant from real life—until now.

Maya's **pet** /pet/ (n. 宠物) project was a medical **robot** that could **form** /fɔːrm/ (v./n. 形成；表格) a **net** /net/ (n. 网；网状物) of tiny sensors. These sensors could detect problems in the human body without surgery. "It's **fantastic** /fænˈtæstɪk/ (adj. 极好的；奇异的)," her colleague said. "But the **timing** /ˈtaɪmɪŋ/ (n. 时机；定时) is terrible. We need another **thousand** /ˈθaʊznd/ (n./num. 一千) hours of testing."

Maya looked at the medical **record** /ˈrekɔːrd/ (n./v. 记录；唱片) on her desk. Lina's **stomach** /ˈstʌmək/ (n. 胃；腹部) pain was getting worse. Doctors couldn't find the **solution** /səˈluːʃn/ (n. 解决方案；溶液). "I don't have a thousand hours," Maya said. She made a decision that would **eliminate** /ɪˈlɪmɪneɪt/ (v. 消除；淘汰) doubt but increase risk.

**That** night, Maya worked without sleep. Her phone would **ring** /rɪŋ/ (v./n. 响铃；戒指) with messages, but she ignored them. By morning, she had finished a special **form** of the device—not ready for **export** /ˈekspɔːrt/ (n./v. 出口；输出) or commercial use, but **maybe** good enough for one person.

"I want to test it on myself first," Maya told Lina. But Lina shook her head. "No. This is my **chance** /tʃæns/ (n./v. 机会；偶然). You gave me this gift. Let me use it." Maya's **stomach** felt tight with fear. **That** brave **trait** /treɪt/ (n. 特征；品质) was what made Lina special.

The test began with a small **bang** /bæŋ/ (n./v. 砰的一声；猛击)—the sound of the machine starting. The sensors moved through Lina's body like a gentle **net**, sending data to Maya's computer. Within minutes, they found the problem: a small growth pressing on nerves. It was the kind of thing doctors might **miss** for months.

"We did it," Maya whispered. Her **writing** /ˈraɪtɪŋ/ (n. 写作；文字) in the research notes suddenly felt alive. The data was not just numbers—it was hope.

A **congressman** /ˈkɑːŋɡrəsmən/ (n. 国会议员；众议员) later visited Maya's lab. He wanted to know about her invention. "This technology could change healthcare," he said. "We should support its development." Maya smiled but thought of Lina. Fame and funding were good, but the real prize was her **sister** walking through the **exit** /ˈeksɪt/ (n./v. 出口；离开) of the hospital, healthy again.

Maya realized that innovation was not about creating the future in some **abstract** way. It was about solving problems for the people you love—right now, with whatever tools you have.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

玛雅轻轻地摸着姐姐的头发。莉娜已经生病好几个月了，接受使她虚弱的放射治疗。"也许科学能帮忙，"玛雅想。她是机器人设计领域的领先工程师，但她的工作感觉远离现实生活——直到现在。

玛雅的宠物项目是一个医疗机器人，它可以形成一个由微型传感器组成的网络。这些传感器可以在不做手术的情况下检测人体中的问题。"这太棒了，"她的同事说。"但时机很糟糕。我们还需要一千个小时的测试。"

玛雅看着桌上的医疗记录。莉娜的胃痛越来越严重。医生找不到解决方案。"我没有一千个小时，"玛雅说。她做出了一个会消除怀疑但增加风险的决定。

那天晚上，玛雅不眠不休地工作。她的手机会响起信息，但她忽略了它们。到早上，她完成了设备的一个特殊形式——还没准备好出口或商业使用，但也许对一个人来说足够好。

"我想先在自己身上测试，"玛雅告诉莉娜。但莉娜摇了摇头。"不。这是我的机会。你给了我这份礼物。让我用它。"玛雅的胃因恐惧而紧绷。那种勇敢的特质正是莉娜的特别之处。

测试以一声砰响开始——机器启动的声音。传感器像一张温柔的网一样穿过莉娜的身体，将数据发送到玛雅的电脑。几分钟之内，他们发现了问题：一个小的肿块压迫着神经。这是医生可能会错过数月的那种东西。

"我们成功了，"玛雅低声说。她在研究笔记中的记录突然变得生动起来。数据不仅仅是数字——它是希望。

一位国会议员后来参观了玛雅的实验室。他想了解她的发明。"这项技术可能会改变医疗保健，"他说。"我们应该支持它的发展。"玛雅微笑了，但想到了莉娜。名声和资金都很好，但真正的奖赏是她的姐姐健康地走出医院出口。

玛雅意识到创新不是以某种抽象的方式创造未来。而是用你拥有的任何工具，为你爱的人解决问题——就在此刻。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "She was a leading engineer in robot design, but her work felt distant from real life—until now."

**分析:** "until now" 放在句末，表示时间上的转折点，强调之前和现在的对比。破折号的使用制造了戏剧性的停顿，增强了转折的效果。"feel distant from" 表示"感觉与...疏远"。

**亮点:** "until now" 是故事中常用的转折语，标志着主人公认识或处境的重要改变。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "I don't have a thousand hours."

**分析:** 简短有力的句子，表达了紧迫感和决心。使用具体数字（a thousand hours）而不是模糊表达（much time），让情况更加具体和紧迫。

**亮点:** 在关键时刻使用短句可以创造强烈的情感冲击力。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "The data was not just numbers—it was hope."

**分析:** 这是一个对比式的哲理句。"not just A—it was B" 结构通过否定表面价值，揭示更深层的意义。破折号后的内容是情感升华。

**亮点:** 这种句式常用于文章的高潮或结尾，用于揭示事物的本质或更深层次的意义。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Innovation was not about creating the future in some abstract way. It was about solving problems for the people you love."

**分析:** 又一个对比结构，通过否定抽象概念（abstract way）而肯定具体行动（solving problems），表达了作者的主题思想。"the people you love" 使用定语从句，让表达更具体和情感化。

**亮点:** 文章结尾用这种对比式总结，能够升华主题，给读者留下深刻印象。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 定语从句中的 That

**原句:** "Lina had been sick for months, receiving radiation treatment that made her weak."

**聚焦:** That 引导限制性定语从句

**用法说明:**
"That" 可以引导定语从句，修饰前面的名词（这里是 radiation treatment）。在定语从句中，that 可以指代人或物，在从句中作主语或宾语。

**That vs. Which:**
- That: 引导限制性定语从句（不用逗号隔开）
  - The book that I bought is interesting. (我买的那本书很有趣)
  
- Which: 引导非限制性定语从句（用逗号隔开）
  - The book, which I bought yesterday, is interesting. (这本书很有趣，我昨天买的)

**何时只能用 That:**
1. 先行词被最高级修饰：the best solution that we have
2. 先行词被序数词修饰：the first person that arrived
3. 先行词包含人和物：the people and places that I remember

**可替换句:** "Lina had been sick for months, receiving radiation treatment which made her weak." (较正式)

---

### 聚焦点 2: Maybe vs. May be

**原句:** "Maybe science can help."

**聚焦:** Maybe (副词) vs. May be (情态动词 + 动词)

**用法说明:**
- **Maybe** /ˈmeɪbi/ - 副词，意为"也许、可能"，通常放在句首
  - Maybe we should leave early.
  - Maybe he is right.

- **May be** - 情态动词 may + 动词 be，意为"可能是"
  - He may be at home. (他可能在家)
  - This may be true. (这可能是真的)

**记忆技巧:**
如果可以替换为 "perhaps"，就用 maybe（一个词）。
如果可以替换为 "might be"，就用 may be（两个词）。

**对比例句:**
- Maybe she knows. = Perhaps she knows. ✓
- She may be there. = She might be there. ✓

**思考方向:**
- 个人动机 vs. 科学研究
- 技术的人性化
- 创新的驱动力
- 伦理与风险

---
