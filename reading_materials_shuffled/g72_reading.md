## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **downtown** /ˈdaʊntaʊn/ (adj. 市中心的) gym was quiet on Sunday morning. Maria sat in the **locker** /ˈlɑːkər/ (n. 储物柜) room, drying her hair with a **towel** /ˈtaʊəl/ (n. 毛巾). She **usually** /ˈjuːʒuəli/ (adv. 通常) came here to **relax** /rɪˈlæks/ (v. 放松), but today she had a **major** /ˈmeɪdʒər/ (adj. 重要的) decision to make. Her lawyer had called about the **verdict** /ˈvɜːrdɪkt/ (n. 裁决) in her case. The jury wanted to **sue** /suː/ (v. 起诉) the company for damages.

"The **entire** /ɪnˈtaɪər/ (adj. 全部的) process has been exhausting," Maria thought. She had been counting **calorie** /ˈkæləri/ (n. 卡路里) intake carefully, trying to stay healthy during the stress. **Seven** /ˈsevn/ (num. 七) months had passed since she became an **advocate** /ˈædvəkeɪt/ (n. 倡导者) for worker rights. The new **legislation** /ˌledʒɪsˈleɪʃn/ (n. 立法) would help others avoid her **experience** /ɪkˈspɪriəns/ (n. 经历).

At the gym's **reception** /rɪˈsepʃn/ (n. 接待处), Maria saw her friend Chen. "Want to **switch** /swɪtʃ/ (v. 转换) to the **solar** /ˈsoʊlər/ (adj. 太阳能的) panel class?" he asked. "I heard it's **fine** /faɪn/ (adj. 好的)." Maria smiled. "That's an **artistic** /ɑːrˈtɪstɪk/ (adj. 艺术的) way to say yoga," she laughed. "But I have a **suggestion** /səˈdʒestʃən/ (n. 建议)—let's have coffee instead. I need to talk."

Over coffee, Maria shared her thoughts. "The **latter** /ˈlætər/ (adj. 后者的) option means accepting a small settlement," she explained. "But the **prospect** /ˈprɑːspekt/ (n. 前景) of helping others through **divine** /dɪˈvaɪn/ (adj. 神圣的) justice seems worth fighting for." Chen listened. "Each **portion** /ˈpɔːrʃn/ (n. 部分) of your journey matters," he said. "**Watch** /wɑːtʃ/ (v. 观察) what feels right, not just what seems logical."

By evening, Maria had decided. She would continue the fight. The journey was long, but every step counted.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

市中心的健身房在周日早上很安静。玛丽亚坐在储物柜室,用毛巾擦干头发。她通常来这里放松,但今天她有一个重要的决定要做。她的律师打电话告诉她案件的裁决。陪审团想起诉公司要求赔偿。

"整个过程都令人筋疲力尽,"玛丽亚想。她一直在仔细计算卡路里摄入,试图在压力期间保持健康。自从她成为工人权利倡导者以来,七个月过去了。新的立法将帮助其他人避免她的经历。

在健身房的接待处,玛丽亚看到了她的朋友陈。"想转到太阳能电池板课程吗?"他问。"我听说很好。" 玛丽亚笑了。"那是说瑜伽的艺术方式,"她笑道。"但我有一个建议——让我们改喝咖啡吧。我需要谈谈。"

喝咖啡时,玛丽亚分享了她的想法。"后者选项意味着接受小额和解,"她解释说。"但通过神圣的正义帮助他人的前景似乎值得为之奋斗。" 陈听着。"你旅程的每一部分都很重要,"他说。"观察什么感觉对,而不仅仅是什么看起来合乎逻辑。"

到傍晚,玛丽亚已经决定了。她将继续战斗。旅程很长,但每一步都很重要。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The entire process has been exhausting."

**分析:** 现在完成时 "has been" 表示从过去开始一直持续到现在的状态。entire 强调整体性,exhausting 是现在分词作表语,表示主动含义"令人筋疲力尽的"。

**亮点:** 用简洁的句子展现人物长期承受的压力,为读者建立同理心。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "The latter option means accepting a small settlement."

**分析:** latter 指两者中的后者,与 former (前者) 相对。mean 后接动名词 accepting 作宾语,表示"意味着"。small 修饰 settlement,暗示妥协。

**亮点:** 通过对比两个选项,展现人物面临的两难抉择。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Watch what feels right, not just what seems logical."

**分析:** watch 在这里表示"注意、观察"。what 引导两个宾语从句。"not just...but..." 结构暗示了情感与理智的对比。feels 和 seems 都是系动词。

**亮点:** 给出富有哲理的建议,强调情感判断与理性分析同等重要。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "The prospect of helping others through divine justice seems worth fighting for."

**分析:** "prospect of doing" 表示"做某事的前景"。through 表示方式。"be worth doing" 是固定搭配,表示"值得做"。介词 for 与 fight 搭配。

**亮点:** 用升华的语言表达人物的价值观和使命感。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 现在完成时表持续状态

**原句:** "The entire process has been exhausting."

**聚焦:** 现在完成时 "has been + 形容词"

**用法说明:** 
现在完成时 "has/have been + 形容词/名词" 用来描述从过去某时开始一直持续到现在的状态。这个结构强调状态的延续性。区别于一般过去时,现在完成时暗示这个状态可能仍在继续,或对现在有影响。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: The entire process
- 谓语: has been (现在完成时)
- 表语: exhausting (令人疲惫的)

**类似表达:**
- This work has been challenging. (这项工作一直很有挑战性)
- The weather has been wonderful this week. (这周的天气一直很好)
- She has been sick for three days. (她已经病了三天了)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "be worth doing" 结构

**原句:** "The prospect seems worth fighting for."

**聚焦:** "be worth doing" 表示价值

**用法说明:**
"be worth doing" 表示"值得做某事",worth 后面必须接动名词 (doing),不能接不定式。注意 doing 形式上是主动的,但意义上是被动的。如果动词需要介词,介词要保留在句尾。

**结构对比:**
- It is worth reading. (值得读 - 被动含义)
- It is worth fighting for. (值得为之奋斗 - 保留介词 for)
- 错误: ~~It is worth to read.~~ (不能用不定式)

**同义表达:**
- It is worthwhile fighting for this. (用 worthwhile + doing/to do)
- It deserves to be fought for. (用 deserve to be done)
