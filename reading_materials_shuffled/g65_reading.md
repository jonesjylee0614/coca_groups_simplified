## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **championship** /ˈtʃæmpiənʃɪp/ (n. 锦标赛) was only one **month** /mʌnθ/ (n. 月) away, and Maya felt the pressure in **every** /ˈevri/ (det. 每个) **muscle** /ˈmʌsl/ (n. 肌肉) of her body. She was an **athlete** /ˈæθliːt/ (n. 运动员) who trained in the small **garden** /ˈɡɑːrdn/ (n. 花园) behind her home, where **other** /ˈʌðər/ (adj. 其他的) runners would practice too. The **structural** /ˈstrʌktʃərəl/ (adj. 结构的) design of their training **protocol** /ˈproʊtəkɔːl/ (n. 协议；规程) was strict, and she followed it with **endless** /ˈendləs/ (adj. 无尽的) dedication.

But today was different. Maya had to appear in court to give **testimony** /ˈtestɪmoʊni/ (n. 证词) in a case involving a **prosecutor** /ˈprɑːsɪkjuːtər/ (n. 检察官) who wanted to **expose** /ɪkˈspoʊz/ (v. 揭露) corruption in sports. A **group** /ɡruːp/ (n. 团体) of officials had tried to impose unfair **restriction** /rɪˈstrɪkʃn/ (n. 限制) on **athletes**, claiming it was a safety **principle** /ˈprɪnsəpl/ (n. 原则). **Beneath** /bɪˈniːθ/ (prep. 在...之下) the surface, though, it was about money and control.

"The **likelihood** /ˈlaɪklihʊd/ (n. 可能性) of winning your case is high," her lawyer said. "But this might affect your **debut** /deɪˈbjuː/ (n. 首次亮相) at the championship."

Maya sat in the witness chair, **eager** /ˈiːɡər/ (adj. 渴望的) to tell the truth. The courtroom felt cold, but she remembered the warmth of her training ground by the sea, where the **tide** /taɪd/ (n. 潮汐) would roll in as she ran. That place was her **resort** /rɪˈzɔːrt/ (n. 度假地；依靠), her escape from worry. She thought of her **relative** /ˈrelətɪv/ (n. 亲戚), her uncle, who had taught her that true champions stand for something bigger than themselves.

"Can you explain how this affects the **culture** /ˈkʌltʃər/ (n. 文化) of fair play?" the prosecutor asked.

Maya spoke clearly, describing how rules should protect **athletes**, not **restrict** them. She mentioned a **molecule** /ˈmɑːlɪkjuːl/ (n. 分子) of doubt she'd seen in young runners' eyes—fear that they couldn't succeed without connections. She wanted to change that.

When she finished, the judge thanked her. Walking out into the bright sun, Maya felt lighter. The **cotton** /ˈkɑːtn/ (n. 棉花) shirt she wore stuck to her back from the heat, but she smiled. The championship was still waiting, and now she could run with a clear heart.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

距离锦标赛只有一个月了，玛雅感到压力充满了她身体的每一块肌肉。她是一名运动员，在家后面的小花园里训练，其他跑步者也会在那里练习。他们训练规程的结构设计非常严格，她以无尽的奉献精神遵循着它。

但今天不同。玛雅必须出庭作证，参与一个案件，其中一位检察官想要揭露体育界的腐败。一群官员试图对运动员施加不公平的限制,声称这是安全原则。然而在表面之下,这关乎金钱和控制。

"你的案子获胜的可能性很高,"她的律师说。"但这可能会影响你在锦标赛上的首次亮相。"

玛雅坐在证人席上,渴望说出真相。法庭感觉很冷,但她记得海边训练场的温暖,那里潮汐会在她跑步时涌来。那个地方是她的度假地,她逃离忧虑的依靠。她想起了她的亲戚,她的叔叔,他教会她真正的冠军要为比自己更大的事情而战。

"你能解释这如何影响公平竞赛的文化吗?"检察官问道。

玛雅清晰地陈述,描述规则应该保护运动员,而不是限制他们。她提到她在年轻跑步者眼中看到的一丝怀疑——害怕没有关系就无法成功。她想改变这一点。

当她完成时,法官感谢了她。走进明亮的阳光中,玛雅感觉轻松了。她穿的棉衬衫因为炎热粘在背上,但她笑了。锦标赛仍在等待,现在她可以带着清澈的心去奔跑了。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Maya felt the pressure in every muscle of her body."

**分析:** 这句使用了介词短语 "in every muscle" 来具象化抽象的压力感受。"feel...in" 结构将心理压力转化为身体感受，这是英语写作中常用的感官化描写技巧。

**亮点:** 通过身体部位的具体描述，让读者能感同身受地体会主人公的紧张状态，增强了叙事的代入感。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Beneath the surface, though, it was about money and control."

**分析:** "beneath the surface" 是一个常用习语，表示"表面之下"或"实际上"。"though" 作为插入语使用，增加了句子的节奏感。整句采用了对比手法，揭示表象与真相的差距。

**亮点:** 这种"表里不一"的表达方式在英语叙事中很常见，既简洁又深刻，适合揭示社会问题。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "That place was her resort, her escape from worry."

**分析:** 这句使用了同位语结构，"her escape from worry" 进一步解释 "her resort"。这种重复解释的方式在文学作品中常见，起到强调和深化情感的作用。

**亮点:** "resort" 一词双关，既指实际的地点，也指精神上的依靠，展现了词汇的丰富内涵。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "She mentioned a molecule of doubt she'd seen in young runners' eyes."

**分析:** "a molecule of doubt" 是一个富有创意的比喻，用科学术语 "molecule"（分子）来形容微小但真实存在的怀疑。"she'd seen" 是 "she had seen" 的缩写，使用过去完成时表示在作证之前已经观察到的情况。

**亮点:** 这种将科学概念与抽象情感相结合的比喻手法，既新颖又准确，展现了作者的语言创造力。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 过去完成时的使用

**原句:** "She mentioned a molecule of doubt she'd seen in young runners' eyes."

**聚焦:** 过去完成时 (had seen) 的使用

**用法说明:**
这里使用过去完成时表示"看到怀疑"这个动作发生在"提到"（mentioned）这个过去动作之前。在叙述过去事件时，过去完成时帮助我们区分时间的先后顺序。

**时态对比:**
- 一般过去时: "She mentioned the doubt she saw" (两个动作似乎同时发生)
- 过去完成时: "She mentioned the doubt she'd seen" (强调"看到"在"提到"之前)

**可替换句:** "She mentioned that she had previously observed doubt in young runners' eyes."

---

### 聚焦点 2: 定语从句的简化

**原句:** "She was an athlete who trained in the small garden behind her home."

**聚焦:** 定语从句的使用

**用法说明:**
"who trained in the small garden" 是一个定语从句，修饰先行词 "athlete"。在英语中，定语从句可以提供关于主语的额外信息，使句子更加丰富和具体。

**结构分析:**
- 主句: She was an athlete
- 定语从句: who trained in the small garden behind her home
- 关系代词: who (指人，在从句中作主语)

**可替换句:** "She was an athlete. She trained in the small garden behind her home." (分成两个简单句，但不如原句流畅)
