**#Adventure** – A story of survival and teamwork

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **telephone** /ˈtelɪfoʊn/ (n. 电话) rang in the ranger station just as the **warning** /ˈwɔːrnɪŋ/ (n. 警告) lights began flashing. A group of **twenty** /ˈtwenti/ (num. 二十) hikers were trapped on the **mountain** /ˈmaʊntn/ (n. 山;山脉), caught in a **deadly** /ˈdedli/ (adj. 致命的;极度的) **storm** /stɔːrm/ (n. 暴风雨). The **trail** /treɪl/ (n. 小径;痕迹) they had taken was now blocked by **mud** /mʌd/ (n. 泥;泥浆) and fallen trees.

"We need to **lift** /lɪft/ (v. 举起;提升) our spirits and act fast," said Captain Torres, the head of the rescue team from the **republic's** /rɪˈpʌblɪks/ (n. 共和国的) mountain rescue **institution** /ˌɪnstɪˈtuːʃn/ (n. 机构;制度). "**Sometimes** /ˈsʌmtaɪmz/ (adv. 有时) we face situations **far** /fɑːr/ (adv./adj. 远;遥远的) worse than this, but we must **decide** /dɪˈsaɪd/ (v. 决定) quickly."

His **adviser** /ədˈvaɪzər/ (n. 顾问;指导教师), Maria, checked the weather forecast **online** /ˈɑːnlaɪn/ (adj./adv. 在线的;联网的). The **improvement** /ɪmˈpruːvmənt/ (n. 改善;改进) in conditions wasn't expected for hours. They would have to go in now, despite the danger. The **existing** /ɪɡˈzɪstɪŋ/ (adj. 现存的;现行的) protocols required a **guard** /ɡɑːrd/ (n./v. 警卫;守卫) remain at the base, but everyone else would join the mission.

"We must protect **ourselves** /ɑːrˈselvz/ (pron. 我们自己)," Maria said, "but those hikers are counting on us. One of them called from a **booth** /buːθ/ (n. 电话亭;小隔间) before their phones died. They mentioned someone with a **religious** /rɪˈlɪdʒəs/ (adj. 宗教的) medal who was keeping everyone calm."

The team packed **extra** /ˈekstrə/ (adj./n. 额外的;临时演员) supplies and headed up the **mountain**. The **inflation** /ɪnˈfleɪʃn/ (n. 通货膨胀;充气) of their emergency shelter took only minutes—they would need it if anyone couldn't walk. As they climbed, Torres thought about the **root** /ruːt/ (n. 根;根源) cause of such accidents: people underestimating nature's power.

Three hours into the rescue, they heard voices. The hikers were huddled in a natural **cave** /keɪv/ (n. 洞穴), cold but alive. The man with the **religious** medal smiled weakly. "We were about to **crash** /kræʃ/ (v./n. 碰撞;崩溃)," he said, "but **we** /wiː/ (pron. 我们) kept hoping."

Torres assessed the situation. Everyone needed medical attention, but no one was in **critical** /ˈkrɪtɪkl/ (adj. 关键的;批评的) condition. "This **trail** back will be slow," he warned. "But if we **lift** each other up—literally and figuratively—we'll make it."

The descent was careful. When mudslides threatened to make them **crash** into rocks, the team used ropes. Each rescued hiker was a victory. By dawn, all **twenty** were safe at the base station, wrapped in blankets, sipping hot drinks.

"**Sometimes**," Maria reflected, "the best **improvement** we can make is simply being **there** /ðer/ (adv. 在那里) for others. The **existing** systems work, but it's the human spirit—**religious** or not—that truly saves lives. That **telephone** call reminded us: we're never truly **alone** /əˈloʊn/ (adj./adv. 独自的) when we look out for each other."

Captain Torres nodded, thinking how **far** they had come that night, and how the **roots** /ruːts/ (n. 根;根源) of courage run deep in those who choose to help.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

电话在护林站响起,就在警告灯开始闪烁的时候。一群二十名徒步旅行者被困在山上,遭遇了致命的暴风雨。他们走的小径现在被泥浆和倒下的树木堵住了。

"我们需要振作精神,迅速行动,"来自共和国山地救援机构负责人托雷斯上尉说。"有时候我们面临的情况比这糟糕得多,但我们必须快速决定。"

他的顾问玛丽亚在线查看了天气预报。几个小时内预计不会有所改善。尽管危险,他们现在必须进去。现行的协议要求一名警卫留在基地,但其他所有人都将加入任务。

"我们必须保护自己,"玛丽亚说,"但那些徒步旅行者指望着我们。其中一人在手机没电前从电话亭打来电话。他们提到有人带着宗教奖章,正在让每个人保持冷静。"

团队打包了额外的补给品,向山上进发。他们的紧急避难所的充气只需几分钟——如果有人不能走路,他们会需要它。在攀登时,托雷斯想到了这类事故的根源:人们低估了自然的力量。

救援三小时后,他们听到了声音。徒步旅行者挤在一个天然洞穴里,又冷但还活着。带着宗教奖章的男人微弱地笑了。"我们本来要崩溃了,"他说,"但我们一直抱有希望。"

托雷斯评估了情况。每个人都需要医疗护理,但没有人处于危急状态。"回去的小径会很慢,"他警告说。"但如果我们互相扶持——字面上和比喻上——我们会成功的。"

下山很小心。当泥石流威胁要让他们撞到岩石上时,团队使用了绳索。每个获救的徒步旅行者都是一次胜利。到黎明时,所有二十人都在基地安全,裹着毯子,啜饮热饮。

"有时候,"玛丽亚反思道,"我们能做的最好的改进就是简单地为他人在场。现有系统有效,但真正拯救生命的是人类精神——无论是否宗教。那个电话提醒我们:当我们互相照顾时,我们从不真正孤单。"

托雷斯上尉点点头,想着那晚他们走了多远,以及选择帮助的人们的勇气之根扎得多深。

### 句子 3
**原句:** "If we lift each other up—literally and figuratively—we'll make it."
