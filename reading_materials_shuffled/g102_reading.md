**#Adventure** – A story of discovery and perseverance

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Dr. Maya Chen stood **before** /bɪˈfɔːr/ (prep./conj. 在...之前) the jungle that had **exist** /ɪɡˈzɪst/ (v. 存在) for millions of years. As a wildlife **developer** /dɪˈveləpər/ (n. 开发者;研发人员), she had traveled here to study **elephant** /ˈelɪfənt/ (n. 大象) migration patterns. Her **mood** /muːd/ (n. 情绪;心情) was a mix of excitement and worry. This expedition would either **guarantee** /ˌɡærənˈtiː/ (v./n. 保证;担保) her research funding or **prohibit** /prəˈhɪbɪt/ (v. 禁止;阻止) her career from advancing.

The **indigenous** /ɪnˈdɪdʒənəs/ (adj. 本土的;土著的) guide, a man whose **lifestyle** /ˈlaɪfstaɪl/ (n. 生活方式) seemed perfectly suited to the wilderness, led them through dense vegetation. "The **stream** /striːm/ (n. 小溪;水流) ahead will **cover** /ˈkʌvər/ (v. 覆盖;涵盖) our tracks," he **explain** /ɪkˈspleɪn/ (v. 解释;说明)ed. Maya admired his knowledge—a **technique** /tekˈniːk/ (n. 技术;技巧) passed down through generations.

They reached a clearing where ancient trees formed a natural **concert** /ˈkɑːnsərt/ (n. 音乐会;一致) hall. Birds sang in perfect harmony. "We must **organize** /ˈɔːrɡənaɪz/ (v. 组织;安排) our camp here," the guide suggested. Maya agreed, though she wanted to push forward. The **magnitude** /ˈmæɡnɪtuːd/ (n. 巨大;重要性) of their task was overwhelming—tracking a **single** /ˈsɪŋɡl/ (adj. 单一的;单身的) herd across hundreds of miles.

As night fell, Maya reviewed her notes. She needed to **publish** /ˈpʌblɪʃ/ (v. 出版;发表) findings that would help **impose** /ɪmˈpoʊz/ (v. 强加;征税) stronger protections for these creatures. **Someday** /ˈsʌmdeɪ/ (adv. 将来有一天;总有一天), she hoped, people would understand that every species deserves to **exist** without threat.

The next morning brought challenges. A government **sergeant** /ˈsɑːrdʒənt/ (n. 警官;中士) arrived with a **statement** /ˈsteɪtmənt/ (n. 声明;陈述): new regulations would **prohibit** entry to this region. Maya's heart sank. "Can't you see the **magnitude** of what we're doing?" she argued. "These **elephant**s are dying. We're not here to harm—we're here to help **organize** conservation **effort**s."

The sergeant, a young man wearing a dusty **coat** /koʊt/ (n. 外套;涂层), looked uncomfortable. "I have orders to **impose** these rules. The government wants to **nominate** /ˈnɑːmɪneɪt/ (v. 提名;任命) this area as a protected zone, but until then, I must ask you to leave." Maya realized he wasn't the enemy—he was caught between duty and conscience.

She pulled out her **clinical** /ˈklɪnɪkl/ (adj. 临床的;冷静客观的) research data. "Look at these numbers. The **stream** is polluted. The **elephant** population has declined. If we don't study their patterns now, we'll lose critical information." Her voice was calm but firm. "I'm not asking for special treatment—just time to complete what we started."

The sergeant studied the documents. Finally, he spoke: "I can give you three days. Use them well. And **someday**, when you **publish** this work, mention that not all of us are blind to what matters." Maya felt relief wash **cover** her like rain. "Thank you. This will make a real difference."

Over the next three days, Maya and her team worked tirelessly. They tracked the **elephant**s, analyzed water samples from the **stream**, and documented **indigenous** plant species. The **technique**s they used were simple but effective. Each discovery confirmed what Maya had suspected: this ecosystem was in crisis.

On the final evening, the guide prepared a traditional meal. "You work like our ancestors," he said. "They understood that to **exist** in harmony with nature, one must first **explain** its language." Maya smiled. "That's what science is—learning to listen."

When they left, Maya promised to return. Her **statement** to the press would be powerful, her data irrefutable. The **magnitude** of the task ahead was enormous, but she felt ready. **Before** this trip, she'd been a researcher. Now, she was an **advocate**—and nothing could **prohibit** her from fighting for what mattered.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

玛雅·陈博士站在这片存在了数百万年的丛林前。作为一名野生动物研发人员,她来到这里研究大象的迁徙模式。她的心情是兴奋和担忧的混合。这次探险要么保证她的研究资金,要么阻止她的职业发展。

土著向导——一个生活方式完美适应荒野的男人——带领他们穿过茂密的植被。"前面的小溪会覆盖我们的踪迹,"他解释道。玛雅钦佩他的知识——这是代代相传的技术。

他们到达了一片空地,古老的树木形成了一个天然音乐厅。鸟儿和谐地歌唱。"我们必须在这里组织营地,"向导建议道。玛雅同意了,尽管她想继续前进。他们任务的巨大性令人不知所措——追踪单一的象群跨越数百英里。

夜幕降临时,玛雅回顾她的笔记。她需要发表研究结果,以帮助强加对这些生物的更强保护。总有一天,她希望,人们会理解每个物种都应该在没有威胁的情况下存在。

第二天早上带来了挑战。一名政府警官带着声明到来:新规定将禁止进入这个地区。玛雅的心沉了下去。"你难道看不到我们所做事情的重要性吗?"她争辩道。"这些大象正在死亡。我们不是来伤害——我们是来帮助组织保护工作的。"

警官,一个穿着满是灰尘外套的年轻人,看起来很不舒服。"我有命令要强加这些规则。政府想提名这个区域为保护区,但在那之前,我必须请你离开。"玛雅意识到他不是敌人——他夹在职责和良心之间。

她拿出临床研究数据。"看看这些数字。小溪被污染了。大象数量下降了。如果我们现在不研究它们的模式,我们将失去关键信息。"她的声音平静但坚定。"我不是要求特殊待遇——只是时间来完成我们开始的事情。"

警官研究了文件。最后,他说:"我可以给你三天时间。好好利用它们。总有一天,当你发表这项工作时,提一下我们并非都对重要的事情视而不见。"玛雅感到如释重负。"谢谢。这将产生真正的影响。"

在接下来的三天里,玛雅和她的团队不知疲倦地工作。他们追踪大象,分析小溪的水样,并记录本土植物物种。他们使用的技术简单但有效。每一个发现都证实了玛雅的怀疑:这个生态系统正处于危机之中。

在最后一个晚上,向导准备了传统餐食。"你像我们的祖先一样工作,"他说。"他们理解要与自然和谐共存,首先必须解释它的语言。"玛雅微笑着。"这就是科学——学会倾听。"

当他们离开时,玛雅承诺会回来。她对媒体的声明将是有力的,她的数据无可辩驳。前方任务的巨大性是巨大的,但她感到准备好了。在这次旅行之前,她是一名研究人员。现在,她是一名倡导者——没有什么能阻止她为重要的事情而战。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "This expedition would either guarantee her research funding or prohibit her career from advancing."

**分析:** "either...or..." 结构表示两种可能性。"prohibit...from doing" 是固定搭配,表示"阻止...做某事"。这个句子展示了高风险情境,制造紧张感。

**亮点:** 使用对立的两个动词 (guarantee vs. prohibit) 强化了抉择的重要性,是叙事中常用的戏剧化手法。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Maya realized he wasn't the enemy—he was caught between duty and conscience."

**分析:** 破折号后的内容解释了前面的判断。"be caught between A and B" 是习语,表示"夹在A和B之间,左右为难"。这种表达揭示了人物的内心冲突。

**亮点:** 这个句子展示了人物性格的深度,避免了简单的"好人坏人"二分法,使故事更加真实。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "They understood that to exist in harmony with nature, one must first explain its language."

**分析:** "to exist in harmony with" 是不定式短语作主语。"one must..." 使用了泛指代词 "one",使表达更正式、更具普遍性。

**亮点:** 这句话具有哲理性,通过"explain nature's language"的隐喻表达了理解自然的重要性。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Before this trip, she'd been a researcher. Now, she was an advocate."

**分析:** 两个简短的句子形成对比,展示人物的转变。"she'd been" (过去完成时) 与 "she was" (一般过去时) 的对比突出了变化的时间节点。

**亮点:** 简洁的对比句式在叙事结尾处升华主题,给读者留下深刻印象。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: "either...or..." 结构

**原句:** "This expedition would either guarantee her research funding or prohibit her career from advancing."

**聚焦:** 表示两种可能性的选择结构

**用法说明:** 
"either...or..." 用于连接两个并列的选项,表示"要么...要么..."。注意动词形式要与最靠近的主语保持一致(就近原则)。

**结构分析:**
- either + 选项A + or + 选项B
- 例句: You can either stay here or come with me.

**可替换句:** "This expedition would guarantee her research funding, or it would prohibit her career from advancing." (分成两个独立句子,但不如原句简洁)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "prohibit...from doing" 固定搭配

**原句:** "...prohibit her career from advancing."

**聚焦:** prohibit 的用法

**用法说明:**
"prohibit somebody/something from doing something" 是固定搭配,表示"禁止/阻止某人/某物做某事"。注意 from 后面要用动名词形式。

**结构对比:**
- prohibit doing: They prohibit smoking here. (禁止做某事)
- prohibit sb from doing: Rules prohibit students from using phones. (禁止某人做某事)

**可替换句:** "...prevent her career from advancing" 或 "...stop her career from advancing" (使用同义词)
