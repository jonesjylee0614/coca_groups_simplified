**#Adventure** – A story of courage and determination

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **pilot** /ˈpaɪlət/ (n. 飞行员) checked her **clothing** /ˈkloʊðɪŋ/ (n. 衣物)—**gray** /ɡreɪ/ (adj. 灰色的) flight suit with **iron** /ˈaɪərn/ (n. 铁) patches on the **sleeve**-s /sliːv/ (n. 袖子). Captain Eva Jensen, **classic** /ˈklæsɪk/ (adj. 经典的) aviator, stood **inside** /ˌɪnˈsaɪd/ (prep. 在...里面) the hangar looking at her damaged plane. The **circumstance**-s /ˈsɜːrkəmstæns/ (n. 情况) were brutal: a storm had torn through last night, leaving **zero** /ˈzɪroʊ/ (n. 零) time for repairs before the rescue mission.

"**Doc**," /dɑːk/ (n. 医生) she called to the medical officer, "we need to decide now." Dr. Martinez, a **fan** /fæn/ (n. 粉丝；扇子) of Eva's **courage** /ˈkɜːrɪdʒ/ (n. 勇气), walked over with his emergency kit. "Three hikers **missing** /ˈmɪsɪŋ/ (adj. 失踪的) in the mountains. **If** the weather holds, we might find them."

Eva ran her hand along the plane's body, feeling where metal had bent. The **fluid** /ˈfluːɪd/ (n. 液体) lines of the aircraft were no longer smooth—**tight** /taɪt/ (adj. 紧的) bolts had loosened, wiring exposed. Yet her **leadership** /ˈliːdərʃɪp/ (n. 领导力) meant not abandoning people in need. She thought of a story her grandmother told her, almost a fairy tale—a **princess** /ˈprɪnsɪs/ (n. 公主) who refused to **remain** /rɪˈmeɪn/ (v. 保持) safe in her castle while villagers suffered.

"We're not **Dutch** /dʌtʃ/ (adj. 荷兰的)," her co-**pilot** muttered, referencing the old saying about courage. "We're Americans with a job to do." Eva smiled at his attempt to lighten the mood. The **everyday** /ˈevriˌdeɪ/ (adj. 日常的) risks of mountain rescue were one thing, but flying a damaged plane was another.

They took off at dawn. Eva had to **contend** /kənˈtend/ (v. 应对) with **flexible** /ˈfleksəbl/ (adj. 灵活的) controls that barely responded. The mountains loomed ahead, **gray** peaks piercing clouds. Her hands gripped the yoke so **tight** her knuckles turned white. Below, she spotted something—a flash of orange. "There!" she shouted.

The descent was terrifying. Wind tried to **beat** /biːt/ (v. 打击) them back, but Eva held steady. They couldn't land, so Dr. Martinez prepared to rappel down. As he descended, Eva saw the three hikers huddled together, one waving weakly. They looked like they'd been trying to **bury** /ˈberi/ (v. 埋葬) themselves in snow for warmth.

The rescue took thirty minutes that felt like hours. When they finally lifted off with all three hikers aboard, Eva felt tears sting her eyes. The plane had held together. Her **courage** had carried them through. As they flew back, the morning sun turned the mountains from **gray** to gold.

"**Classic** Eva," Doc said with a grin. "Never **remain** on the ground when people need help." She nodded, knowing that **inside**, she'd been terrified—but sometimes, **courage** isn't the absence of fear. It's flying anyway.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

飞行员检查着她的衣物——带有铁质补丁的灰色飞行服,补丁在袖子上。经典飞行员伊娃·詹森上尉站在机库里面,看着她受损的飞机。情况很严峻:昨晚一场风暴席卷而过,在救援任务之前留下了零时间进行维修。

"医生,"她叫医疗官,"我们现在需要做决定。"马丁内斯医生是伊娃勇气的粉丝,带着急救包走过来。"三名徒步旅行者在山里失踪了。如果天气保持稳定,我们可能能找到他们。"

伊娃用手抚摸着飞机机身,感受金属弯曲的地方。飞机的流畅线条不再光滑——紧固的螺栓松动了,电线暴露出来。然而,她的领导力意味着不能抛弃需要帮助的人。她想起祖母给她讲的一个故事,几乎就像童话——一位公主拒绝在村民受苦时安全地留在城堡里。

"我们不是荷兰人,"她的副驾驶咕哝道,引用一句关于勇气的老话。"我们是有工作要做的美国人。"伊娃对他试图缓和气氛的努力微笑。山地救援的日常风险是一回事,但驾驶受损飞机是另一回事。

他们在黎明时起飞。伊娃不得不应对几乎没有反应的灵活控制系统。山脉在前方隐现,灰色山峰刺穿云层。她紧握操纵杆,指关节都发白了。下面,她发现了什么——一道橙色的闪光。"在那儿!"她喊道。

下降很可怕。风试图击退他们,但伊娃保持稳定。他们无法降落,所以马丁内斯医生准备绳降。当他下降时,伊娃看到三名徒步旅行者挤在一起,其中一个虚弱地挥手。他们看起来好像一直试图把自己埋在雪里保暖。

救援用了三十分钟,感觉像几个小时。当他们终于载着三名徒步旅行者起飞时,伊娃感到泪水刺痛眼睛。飞机坚持住了。她的勇气带他们度过了难关。当他们飞回时,清晨的阳光把山脉从灰色变成了金色。

"经典的伊娃,"医生咧嘴笑着说。"当人们需要帮助时,永远不会留在地面上。"她点点头,知道在内心深处,她曾经很害怕——但有时候,勇气不是没有恐惧。而是无论如何都要飞行。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "The circumstances were brutal: a storm had torn through last night, leaving zero time for repairs before the rescue mission."

**分析:** 冒号用来引出具体解释。过去完成时 "had torn" 表示在故事开始前已发生。现在分词 "leaving" 作结果状语。

**亮点:** 简洁有力地交代了紧急情况,为故事的紧张感定下基调。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "She thought of a story her grandmother told her, almost a fairy tale—a princess who refused to remain safe in her castle while villagers suffered."

**分析:** 定语从句 "her grandmother told her" 修饰 story。破折号引出进一步解释。"who refused" 定语从句修饰 princess。

**亮点:** 将个人回忆与当前困境联系起来,深化了人物的动机和价值观。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Her hands gripped the yoke so tight her knuckles turned white."

**分析:** "so...that" 结构,省略了 "that"。描述了紧张状态的身体表现。

**亮点:** 通过具体的身体细节传达情绪,而不是直接说"她很紧张"。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Sometimes, courage isn't the absence of fear. It's flying anyway."

**分析:** 对比句式,先否定常见理解,再给出真正的定义。两个短句形成有力的节奏。

**亮点:** 哲理性的总结升华了故事主题,给读者留下深刻印象。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 过去完成时表示"更早的过去"

**原句:** "A storm had torn through last night, leaving zero time for repairs."

**聚焦:** 过去完成时 (had + past participle)

**用法说明:**
尽管有 "last night" 这个明确的过去时间标记,使用过去完成时是为了强调风暴发生在故事主要时间线(伊娃检查飞机)之前,是一个"更早的过去"事件。

**时态对比:**
- 一般过去时: "A storm tore through last night." (简单陈述过去事实)
- 过去完成时: "A storm had torn through last night." (强调这是背景事件,为现在的情况造成影响)

**可替换句:** "Last night's storm tore through, leaving no time for repairs." (用名词短语替代从句)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 现在分词作结果状语

**原句:** "A storm had torn through last night, leaving zero time for repairs."

**聚焦:** 现在分词 "leaving" 作结果状语

**用法说明:**
现在分词可以作结果状语,表示前面动作自然产生的结果。这比使用 "and" 连接两个句子更简洁优雅。

**结构模式:**
- 主句, doing (result)
- 常用于描述自然的、必然的结果

**更多例句:**
- "The earthquake destroyed the bridge, cutting off the village."
- "He worked hard all year, earning a promotion."

**可替换句:** "A storm had torn through last night, and it left zero time for repairs." (用并列句,较口语化)
