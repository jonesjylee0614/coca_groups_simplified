**#SliceOfLife** – A story of assembly, sacrifice, and finding joy

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Maria sat **at** /æt/ (prep. 在) her kitchen table, watching her daughter Emma practice her speech. The **smile** /smaɪl/ (n./v. 微笑) on Emma's face was **lovely** /ˈlʌvli/ (adj. 可爱的；美好的), full of excitement. Emma had been chosen as the **speaker** /ˈspiːkər/ (n. 演讲者；扬声器) for the school **assembly** /əˈsembli/ (n. 集会；装配), and Maria felt a mix of **pleasure** /ˈpleʒər/ (n. 快乐；乐趣) and worry.

"Don't **fail** /feɪl/ (v. 失败；未能) me, Mom," Emma joked, though her voice carried a hint of nerves. Maria had made many **sacrifices** /ˈsækrɪfaɪsɪz/ (n. 牺牲) to give Emma opportunities. After her **marriage** /ˈmærɪdʒ/ (n. 婚姻) ended, Maria had worked double shifts **at** the hospital to pay for Emma's education. She would never **fail** her daughter.

Maria remembered when Emma was little, afraid of everything. She had thought spiders were **scary** /ˈskeri/ (adj. 可怕的；吓人的), and thunderstorms made her hide under the bed. But Maria had been patient, never using harsh words that might **diminish** /dɪˈmɪnɪʃ/ (v. 减少；贬低) Emma's confidence. Instead, she would **note** /noʊt/ (v. 注意；记录) every small victory and celebrate it.

Now Emma stood in the **corner** /ˈkɔːrnər/ (n. 角落；拐角) of the kitchen, practicing her **speech**. She spoke about her **squad** /skwɑːd/ (n. 小队；班) of friends who supported each other. "We don't **slap** /slæp/ (v./n. 拍打；掌击) each other down," Emma said. "We **rise** /raɪz/ (v. 上升；起立) together." Maria felt tears **rise** in her eyes. The **compensation** /ˌkɑːmpenˈseɪʃn/ (n. 补偿；报酬) for all her hard work wasn't money—it was this moment.

Emma continued, "My mom taught me that being **conservative** /kənˈsɜːrvətɪv/ (adj. 保守的；谨慎的) with trust is okay, but we should be generous with hope." She paused, glancing at Maria. "She also taught me that **domestic** /dəˈmestɪk/ (adj. 家庭的；国内的) life, the simple meals and quiet evenings, holds more value than anything fancy."

Maria thought about the old **wood** /wʊd/ (n. 木头；树林) table they sat at, passed down from her grandmother. Life had taught her to find **pleasure** in simple things: a warm **smile**, a shared meal of rice and **beans** /biːnz/ (n. 豆子). She kept a **log** /lɔːɡ/ (n. 日志；原木) of Emma's achievements in a notebook, each entry a treasure.

"Don't **imply** /ɪmˈplaɪ/ (v. 暗示；意味) that success is easy," Emma concluded in her speech. "But don't let **delays** /dɪˈleɪz/ (n. 延迟；耽搁) stop you. Sometimes you have to **spit** /spɪt/ (v./n. 吐；唾沫) out your fear and move forward."

The next day, Maria sat in the school auditorium. When Emma took the stage, she spoke with confidence, and her words were **legitimate** /lɪˈdʒɪtəmət/ (adj. 合法的；正当的) and powerful. As the crowd applauded, Maria knew all her **sacrifices** had meaning. This was her **compensation**, and it was enough.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

玛丽亚坐在厨房的桌子旁,看着女儿艾玛练习演讲。艾玛脸上的微笑很美好,充满兴奋。艾玛被选为学校集会的演讲者,玛丽亚感到快乐和担心交织。

"别让我失望,妈妈,"艾玛开玩笑说,尽管她的声音中带着一丝紧张。玛丽亚为了给艾玛机会做出了许多牺牲。婚姻结束后,玛丽亚在医院加班来支付艾玛的教育费用。她永远不会让女儿失望。

玛丽亚记得艾玛小时候,什么都怕。她认为蜘蛛很可怕,雷暴让她躲在床下。但玛丽亚很有耐心,从不使用可能贬低艾玛信心的严厉话语。相反,她会注意到每一个小小的胜利并庆祝它。

现在艾玛站在厨房的角落里,练习她的演讲。她谈到她的朋友小队互相支持。"我们不会打击彼此,"艾玛说。"我们一起上升。"玛丽亚感到泪水涌上眼眶。她所有辛勤工作的补偿不是金钱——而是这一刻。

艾玛继续说:"我妈妈教我,对信任保持谨慎是可以的,但我们应该慷慨地给予希望。"她停顿了一下,瞥了玛丽亚一眼。"她还教我家庭生活,简单的饭菜和安静的夜晚,比任何花哨的东西都更有价值。"

玛丽亚想起她们坐的那张旧木桌,是从祖母那里传下来的。生活教会她在简单的事物中找到快乐:温暖的微笑,共享的米饭和豆子。她在笔记本上记录着艾玛的成就,每一条都是宝藏。

"不要暗示成功很容易,"艾玛在演讲中总结道。"但不要让延迟阻止你。有时你必须吐出你的恐惧,继续前进。"

第二天,玛丽亚坐在学校礼堂里。当艾玛登台时,她充满自信地演讲,她的话语正当而有力。当人群鼓掌时,玛丽亚知道她所有的牺牲都有意义。这是她的补偿,而且已经足够了。

- 并列句: "She was patient, and she never used harsh words." (较冗长)
- 从句: "She was patient because she never used harsh words." (改变了逻辑关系)

**可替换句:** "She had been patient and had never used harsh words that might diminish Emma's confidence."
