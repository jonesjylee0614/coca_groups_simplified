## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

Emma was a **teenager** /ˈtiːneɪdʒər/ (n. 青少年) who worked **hard** /hɑːrd/ (adj./adv. 努力的;努力地) at everything she did. Living in a small **district** /ˈdɪstrɪkt/ (n. 区域;地区) outside the city, she spent her days between school and the local **research** /rɪˈsɜːrtʃ/ (n./v. 研究) center, where she volunteered. Her current **target** /ˈtɑːrɡɪt/ (n./v. 目标;瞄准) was understanding bee behavior, a topic that fascinated her more **than** /ðæn/ (conj. 比) anything else.

"Can you **describe** /dɪˈskraɪb/ (v. 描述) what you see?" asked Dr. Martinez, the **British** /ˈbrɪtɪʃ/ (adj. 英国的) scientist who led the project. Emma watched as a **bee** /biː/ (n. 蜜蜂) landed on a **leaf** /liːf/ (n. 叶子) at the **entrance** /ˈentrəns/ (n. 入口) of their observation garden. She had read **numerous** /ˈnuːmərəs/ (adj. 许多的) articles about pollination, studied the **vitamin** /ˈvaɪtəmɪn/ (n. 维生素) content in different flowers, and learned how **such** /sʌtʃ/ (adj. 如此的) tiny creatures could **occupy** /ˈɑːkjupaɪ/ (v. 占据;占领) a crucial role in nature.

"The bee seems **suspicious** /səˈspɪʃəs/ (adj. 怀疑的;可疑的)," Emma said. "It's checking the flower carefully, like it senses something wrong." Dr. Martinez smiled. Emma's **analysis** /əˈnæləsɪs/ (n. 分析) was sharp for someone so young.

The **research** /rɪˈsɜːrtʃ/ (n. 研究) station was located **alongside** /əˈlɔːŋsaɪd/ (prep./adv. 在...旁边) an old **rail** /reɪl/ (n. 铁轨;栏杆) line that hadn't been used in decades. Sometimes Emma would sit on the rusty tracks during breaks, watching trains **pitch** /pɪtʃ/ (v./n. 投掷;倾斜) past in the distance. She dreamed of presenting her findings at a major conference, standing **alongside** /əˈlɔːŋsaɪd/ (prep. 在...旁边) real scientists.

"**Uh** /ʌ/ (interj. 呃), Emma?" called James, another volunteer. "The **commander** /kəˈmændər/ (n. 指挥官;司令) of the environmental **district** /ˈdɪstrɪkt/ (n. 区域) is coming to visit next **week** /wiːk/ (n. 星期). Dr. Martinez wants us to prepare a presentation."

Emma felt excitement mixed with fear. This was **hard** /hɑːrd/ (adj. 困难的)—she wasn't used to speaking in front of important people. But Dr. Martinez had **urge** /ɜːrdʒ/ (v. 催促;力劝) her to **share** /ʃer/ (v. 分享) her work, saying young voices needed to be heard. "You can come **anytime** /ˈeniˌtaɪm/ (adv. 任何时候) to practice," he offered.

For days, Emma prepared. She would **describe** /dɪˈskraɪb/ (v. 描述) their findings, explain how pollution could **harm** /hɑːrm/ (v./n. 伤害) bee populations, and **share** /ʃer/ (v. 分享) her **analysis** /əˈnæləsɪs/ (n. 分析) of local flower patterns. She knew **such** /sʌtʃ/ (adj. 这样的) opportunities didn't come often for a **teenager** /ˈtiːneɪdʒər/ (n. 青少年) from a small **district** /ˈdɪstrɪkt/ (n. 地区).

The day arrived. The **commander** /kəˈmændər/ (n. 指挥官), a tall woman with **hard** /hɑːrd/ (adj. 严肃的) eyes, listened as Emma spoke. At first, Emma's voice shook. But as she talked about the **bee** /biː/ (n. 蜜蜂) colonies, about the **numerous** /ˈnuːmərəs/ (adj. 众多的) threats they faced, her passion took over. She showed charts, explained data, and even suggested that every **district** /ˈdɪstrɪkt/ (n. 区域) should have protected bee gardens at the **entrance** /ˈentrəns/ (n. 入口) to public parks.

When she finished, the room was quiet. Emma worried she had said something wrong. Then the **commander** /kəˈmændər/ (n. 指挥官) stood up. "Young lady, that was excellent work. We need more people like you who **occupy** /ˈɑːkjupaɪ/ (v. 从事) themselves with real problems."

Walking home **alongside** /əˈlɔːŋsaɪd/ (prep. 沿着) the old **rail** /reɪl/ (n. 铁轨), Emma felt something had shifted. She had always worked **hard** /hɑːrd/ (adv. 努力地), but now she understood that her voice could **harm** /hɑːrm/ (v. 伤害) ignorance and help create change. The **research** /rɪˈsɜːrtʃ/ (n. 研究) wasn't just about **bee** /biː/ (n. 蜜蜂) behavior—it was about learning to **share** /ʃer/ (v. 分享) knowledge, to speak up, to not be **suspicious** /səˈspɪʃəs/ (adj. 怀疑的) of her own abilities.

Dr. Martinez had told her once: "**Such** /sʌtʃ/ (adj. 这样的) curiosity will **target** /ˈtɑːrɡɪt/ (v. 瞄准) you toward great things." As Emma reached her **district** /ˈdɪstrɪkt/ (n. 区域), passing the familiar **entrance** /ˈentrəns/ (n. 入口) of her neighborhood, she finally believed him. She could be a scientist, a voice for nature, **anytime** /ˈeniˌtaɪm/ (adv. 任何时候) she chose to try.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

艾玛是一个青少年,对她做的每件事都很努力。她住在城外的一个小区域,每天在学校和当地研究中心之间度过,她在那里做志愿者。她目前的目标是理解蜜蜂的行为,这个话题让她着迷,胜过其他任何事情。

"你能描述你看到的吗?"马丁内斯博士问道,他是领导这个项目的英国科学家。艾玛看着一只蜜蜂降落在他们观察花园入口的一片叶子上。她读过许多关于授粉的文章,研究了不同花朵中的维生素含量,并了解到如此微小的生物如何能在自然界占据关键角色。

"这只蜜蜂似乎很怀疑,"艾玛说。"它正在仔细检查花朵,好像感觉到有什么不对劲。"马丁内斯博士微笑了。艾玛的分析对于这么年轻的人来说很敏锐。

研究站位于一条几十年没有使用的旧铁轨旁边。有时艾玛会在休息时坐在生锈的轨道上,看着远处倾斜驶过的火车。她梦想在重要会议上展示她的发现,与真正的科学家并肩站立。

"呃,艾玛?"另一位志愿者詹姆斯叫道。"环境区域的指挥官下周要来参观。马丁内斯博士希望我们准备一个演示。"

艾玛感到兴奋和恐惧交织。这很困难——她不习惯在重要人物面前讲话。但马丁内斯博士催促她分享她的工作,说年轻的声音需要被听到。"你可以随时来练习,"他提议道。

几天来,艾玛做准备。她会描述他们的发现,解释污染如何伤害蜜蜂种群,并分享她对当地花卉模式的分析。她知道这样的机会对来自小区域的青少年来说并不常见。

那一天到了。指挥官是一位高个子女性,眼神严肃,她听着艾玛讲话。起初,艾玛的声音在颤抖。但当她谈到蜜蜂群落,谈到它们面临的众多威胁时,她的热情接管了一切。她展示图表,解释数据,甚至建议每个区域都应该在公园入口处设立受保护的蜜蜂花园。

当她讲完时,房间安静了。艾玛担心她说错了什么。然后指挥官站了起来。"年轻女士,那是出色的工作。我们需要更多像你这样从事真正问题的人。"

沿着旧铁轨走回家,艾玛感到有什么改变了。她一直努力工作,但现在她明白她的声音可以伤害无知并帮助创造变化。这项研究不仅仅是关于蜜蜂的行为——它是关于学习分享知识,大声说话,不对自己的能力持怀疑态度。

马丁内斯博士曾告诉她:"这样的好奇心会引导你走向伟大的事情。"当艾玛到达她的区域,经过她熟悉的社区入口时,她终于相信了他。她可以成为一名科学家,一个为自然发声的人,任何时候只要她选择尝试。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Her current target was understanding bee behavior, a topic that fascinated her more than anything else."

**分析:** 动名词 "understanding bee behavior" 作表语,说明她的目标。"a topic" 是同位语,进一步解释 "bee behavior"。"that" 引导定语从句修饰 "topic","more than anything else" 是比较结构,强调程度。

**亮点:** 通过同位语和定语从句的层层递进,既交代了主人公的目标,又展现了她的热情程度。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "She had read numerous articles about pollination, studied the vitamin content in different flowers, and learned how such tiny creatures could occupy a crucial role in nature."

**分析:** 这是一个并列句,三个动词短语(had read, studied, learned)共用一个主语 "she",展现她做的多项研究工作。最后一个动词 "learned" 后接 "how" 引导的宾语从句,说明学习的内容。

**亮点:** 三个并列动词的使用,有效展示了主人公的勤奋和求知欲,同时保持句子简洁流畅。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "But as she talked about the bee colonies, about the numerous threats they faced, her passion took over."

**分析:** "as" 引导时间状语从句,表示"当...的时候"。"talked about" 后接两个并列的介词短语。主句 "her passion took over" 使用拟人化手法,将 "passion"(热情)描述为可以"接管"的主体。

**亮点:** "took over"(接管)这个短语的使用非常生动,形象地展现了热情战胜恐惧的过程。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "She could be a scientist, a voice for nature, anytime she chose to try."

**分析:** 情态动词 "could" 表示可能性。两个名词短语(a scientist, a voice for nature)作表语,表明她可以成为的两种身份。"anytime she chose to try" 是时间状语从句,其中省略了 "when",完整形式是 "anytime when she chose to try"。

**亮点:** 通过将"科学家"和"自然的声音"并列,升华了故事的主题,让读者看到科学研究更深层的意义。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 动名词作表语

**原句:** "Her current target was understanding bee behavior."

**聚焦:** 动名词 (understanding) 作表语

**用法说明:** 
动名词可以作表语,说明主语的内容或性质。这种用法常见于描述目标、工作、爱好等。在这个句子中,"understanding bee behavior" 说明了 "target"(目标)的具体内容。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: Her current target
- 系动词: was
- 表语: understanding bee behavior (动名词短语)

**可替换句:** "Her current target was to understand bee behavior." (使用不定式,意思相同,但动名词更强调持续的过程)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "how" 引导的宾语从句

**原句:** "She learned how such tiny creatures could occupy a crucial role in nature."

**聚焦:** "how" 引导宾语从句

**用法说明:**
"how" 可以引导宾语从句,表示"如何、怎样"。在这个从句中,"how" 不是疑问句,而是陈述句的一部分,说明学习的内容。从句使用陈述语序(主语 + 动词),而非疑问语序。

**结构分析:**
- 主句: She learned
- 宾语从句: how such tiny creatures could occupy a crucial role in nature
  - 从句主语: such tiny creatures
  - 从句谓语: could occupy
  - 从句宾语: a crucial role

**可替换句:** "She learned that such tiny creatures could occupy a crucial role in nature." (用 "that" 引导,但不如 "how" 强调方式)
