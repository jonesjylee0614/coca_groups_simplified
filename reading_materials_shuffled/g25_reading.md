**#SliceOfLife** – A story of second chances

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **moon** /muːn/ (n. 月亮) hung low over the **site** /saɪt/ (n. 地点) where the old theater once stood. Marcus, a **retired** /rɪˈtaɪərd/ (adj. 退休的) **coach** /koʊtʃ/ (n. 教练), stood with his hands in his pockets, watching workers **fill** /fɪl/ (v. 填充) the foundation with concrete. He had spent **fifteen** /ˌfɪfˈtiːn/ (num. 十五) years training young actors, helping them find their voices. Now, at sixty-five, he was building something new—a community arts center that would be his **legacy** /ˈleɡəsi/ (n. 遗产).

"Your **accent** /ˈæksent/ (n. 口音) gives you away," said Father O'Brien, the local **priest** /priːst/ (n. 牧师). "You're not from here, are you?" Marcus smiled. "True. But I've learned that **creativity** /ˌkriːeɪˈtɪvəti/ (n. 创造力) has no borders. I was **reluctant** /rɪˈlʌktənt/ (adj. 不情愿的) to leave the city at first, but this place needed me."

The center would have **proper** /ˈprɑːpər/ (adj. 适当的) equipment—a stage, lighting, and a **crew** /kruː/ (n. 团队) of volunteers. Marcus wanted it to be a place where **intellectual** /ˌɪntəˈlektʃuəl/ (adj. 智力的) **ambition** /æmˈbɪʃn/ (n. 抱负) met practical skill. The **proportion** /prəˈpɔːrʃn/ (n. 比例) of young people with talent here was **evident** /ˈevɪdənt/ (adj. 明显的), but they lacked resources. "In **terms** /tɜːrmz/ (n. 方面) of opportunity," he told the town council, "we're giving them a chance to be seen, not **invisible** /ɪnˈvɪzəbl/ (adj. 看不见的)."

One evening, a girl named Clara approached him. She had **breathing** /ˈbriːðɪŋ/ (n. 呼吸) problems but dreamed of singing. "Is there room for me?" she asked. Marcus studied her face, seeing both fear and hope. "**Above** /əˈbʌv/ (prep. 在...上面) all else," he said, "this place is for people who refuse to give up. Let me show you a **scene** /siːn/ (n. 场景) from a play I **love**. It's about **conversion** /kənˈvɜːrʒn/ (n. 转变)—how one moment can change everything."

They worked together for months. Clara's **continuous** /kənˈtɪnjuəs/ (adj. 连续的) practice paid off. On opening night, she stood on the **land** /lænd/ (n. 土地) where dreams were now possible. Her voice, once quiet, filled the room. Marcus watched from the wings, his heart full. This wasn't just a building—it was proof that **expertise** /ˌekspɜːrˈtiːz/ (n. 专业知识) combined with care could create something beautiful. Under the **moon**, the theater came alive.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

月亮低垂在曾经的老剧院所在的地点上空。马库斯,一位退休的教练,双手插在口袋里,看着工人们用混凝土填充地基。他花了十五年训练年轻演员,帮助他们找到自己的声音。现在,在六十五岁时,他正在建造新东西——一个社区艺术中心,这将是他的遗产。

"你的口音暴露了你,"当地的牧师奥布莱恩说。"你不是这里人,对吧?"马库斯笑了。"确实。但我学到了创造力没有边界。起初我不情愿离开城市,但这个地方需要我。"

中心将拥有适当的设备——舞台、灯光和一个志愿者团队。马库斯希望这是一个智力抱负与实践技能相遇的地方。这里有才华的年轻人的比例很明显,但他们缺乏资源。"就机会而言,"他告诉市议会,"我们给他们一个被看见的机会,而不是隐形的。"

一天晚上,一个叫克拉拉的女孩走近他。她有呼吸问题,但梦想唱歌。"有我的位置吗?"她问。马库斯端详着她的脸,看到了恐惧和希望。"最重要的是,"他说,"这个地方是为拒绝放弃的人准备的。让我给你看一个我喜欢的戏剧场景。它是关于转变的——一个时刻如何改变一切。"

他们一起工作了几个月。克拉拉持续的练习得到了回报。在开幕之夜,她站在梦想现在成为可能的土地上。她曾经安静的声音充满了整个房间。马库斯在侧幕观看,心中充满了喜悦。这不仅仅是一座建筑——这是专业知识与关怀结合可以创造美好事物的证明。在月光下,剧院焕发了生机。
