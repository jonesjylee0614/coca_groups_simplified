**#SliceOfLife** – A story of family bonds

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **suburb** /ˈsʌbɜːrb/ (n. 郊区) was quiet at **six** o'clock. Elena wore a new **outfit** /ˈaʊtfɪt/ (n. 套装) for her mother's **retirement** /rɪˈtaɪərmənt/ (n. 退休) party. She had spent **four** /fɔːr/ (num. 四) hours preparing, though she felt **guilty** /ˈɡɪlti/ (adj. 内疚的) for not visiting more often. The **initial** /ɪˈnɪʃl/ (adj. 最初的) plan was simple—**bake** /beɪk/ (v. 烘烤) a cake and celebrate. But Elena wanted to do more.

Her mother had been a language teacher, someone who could **communicate** /kəˈmjuːnɪkeɪt/ (v. 交流) in **four** languages. Elena had **learned** /lɜːrnd/ (v. 学习) from her the **universal** /ˌjuːnɪˈvɜːrsl/ (adj. 普遍的) **truth**: family **bonds** /bɑːndz/ (n. 纽带) matter most. Yet work had kept them apart. Elena let out a **sigh** /saɪ/ (n. 叹息). The **cost** /kɔːst/ (n. 代价) of her career had been high.

At the party venue, Elena found her mother reviewing **instructional** /ɪnˈstrʌkʃənl/ (adj. 教学的) materials for a new student. "Mom, you're supposed to be **retired**," Elena said **directly** /dəˈrektli/ (adv. 直接地). Her mother smiled. "Teaching isn't just a **task** /tæsk/ (n. 任务)—it's who I am. This is the **norm** /nɔːrm/ (n. 常态) for me."

Elena pulled out a **photograph** /ˈfoʊtəɡræf/ (n. 照片) she had found. It showed her mother as a young **warrior** /ˈwɔːriər/ (n. 战士) for education, fighting for **liberty** /ˈlɪbərti/ (n. 自由) of thought in schools. "You gave so much," Elena whispered. Her mother took her hand. "And **your** response? A life filled with **romance** /roʊˈmæns/ (n. 浪漫) and purpose. That's enough for me."

Later, as Elena helped a **buyer** /ˈbaɪər/ (n. 购买者) choose flowers for the event, she realized something. Her mother's **ongoing** /ˈɑːnɡoʊɪŋ/ (adj. 持续的) work wasn't about refusing to stop—it was about **choosing** to **lead** /liːd/ (v. 引领) by example. "Mom," Elena said, "I want to **learn** more from you. Not just language, but how to live."

Her mother laughed, brushing off imaginary dust. "Oh **crap** /kræp/ (n. 废话), you're making me cry. Come here." They embraced, and in that moment, Elena understood: **retirement** wasn't an ending—it was freedom to choose what truly mattered.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

郊区在六点钟很安静。埃琳娜为她母亲的退休派对穿了一套新衣服。她花了四个小时准备,尽管她为没有更常拜访而感到内疚。最初的计划很简单——烤一个蛋糕并庆祝。但埃琳娜想做更多。

她的母亲曾是一名语言教师,一个可以用四种语言交流的人。埃琳娜从她那里学到了普遍的真理:家庭纽带最重要。然而工作让他们分开了。埃琳娜叹了口气。她职业生涯的代价很高。

在派对场地,埃琳娜发现她母亲正在为一个新学生审查教学材料。"妈妈,你应该退休了,"埃琳娜直接说。她母亲笑了。"教学不仅仅是一项任务——这就是我。这对我来说是常态。"

埃琳娜拿出她找到的一张照片。它展示了她母亲作为教育战士的年轻形象,为学校的思想自由而奋斗。"你付出了这么多,"埃琳娜低声说。她母亲握住她的手。"而你的回应?一个充满浪漫和目标的生活。这对我来说就够了。"

后来,当埃琳娜帮助一位购买者为活动选择花时,她意识到了一些事情。她母亲持续的工作不是关于拒绝停止——而是关于选择以身作则。"妈妈,"埃琳娜说,"我想从你那里学到更多。不仅是语言,还有如何生活。"

她母亲笑了,拂去想象中的灰尘。"哦废话,你让我哭了。过来这里。"她们拥抱了,在那一刻,埃琳娜明白了:退休不是结束——而是选择真正重要的事情的自由。

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 过去完成时表示"过去的过去"

**原句:** "The cost of her career had been high."

**聚焦:** 过去完成时 (had been)

**用法说明:** 
过去完成时表示在过去某个时间点之前已经完成或存在的动作或状态。这里指在故事发生时(过去),代价已经(在更早之前)变得很高了。过去完成时常用来表示"过去的过去",或者为过去的某个时间点提供背景信息。

**时态对比:**
- 一般过去时: The cost was high. (过去某时代价高)
- 过去完成时: The cost had been high. (在过去某时之前,代价就已经很高了)

**可替换句:** "Her career had cost her a lot." (她的职业让她付出了很多)

---

### 聚焦点 2: 名词性从句作表语

**原句:** "Teaching isn't just a task—it's who I am."

**聚焦:** 名词性从句 "who I am" 作表语

**用法说明:**
"who I am" 是一个名词性从句(又称表语从句),在系动词 "is" 后作表语,说明主语 "it" (指代 teaching) 的本质。这种结构常用来表达身份认同、本质特征等深层含义。

**结构分析:**
- 主语: it (= teaching)
- 系动词: is
- 表语从句: who I am

**类似表达:**
- This is what I believe. (这就是我相信的)
- That's where I live. (那就是我住的地方)
- The question is whether we should go. (问题是我们是否应该去)
