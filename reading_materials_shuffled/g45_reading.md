**#MoralReflection** – A story of perspective and growth

---

## Part 1. Story (英文原文)

The **re-election** /ˌriːɪˈlekʃn/ (n. 再次当选) campaign office buzzed with **energy** /ˈenərdʒi/ (n. 能量). Maya Rodriguez, running for her second term as mayor, sat at **breakfast** /ˈbrekfəst/ (n. 早餐) reviewing the polls. The numbers showed her **influence** /ˈɪnfluəns/ (n. 影响力) had grown, but so had opposition from **Western** /ˈwestərn/ (adj. 西方的) business interests who wanted to **exceed** /ɪkˈsiːd/ (v. 超过) environmental limits.

"We need a clear **definition** /ˌdefɪˈnɪʃn/ (n. 定义) of **victory** /ˈvɪktəri/ (n. 胜利)," her campaign manager said, pouring coffee. "What does winning **look** like?" Maya thought carefully. **Own**-ing /oʊn/ (v. 拥有) this position meant more than votes—it meant protecting what was **vital** /ˈvaɪtl/ (adj. 至关重要的) to the community.

That morning, a **flash** /flæʃ/ (n. 闪光) of memory took Maya back to her childhood. She remembered her grandmother's **written** /ˈrɪtn/ (adj. 书面的) advice, left in a journal: "Never let fear **interfere** /ˌɪntərˈfɪr/ (v. 干涉) with doing right. **Bring** /brɪŋ/ (v. 带来) hope, not promises you can't keep."

A warm **breeze** /briːz/ (n. 微风) drifted through the window as Maya prepared to **face** /feɪs/ (v. 面对) the day's challenges. She had **added** /ˈædɪd/ (v. 增加) a new proposal to her platform: a **combination** /ˌkɑːmbɪˈneɪʃn/ (n. 结合) of green jobs and affordable housing. Critics said she would **lose** /luːz/ (v. 失去) business support, but Maya saw **it** from a different **perspective** /pərˈspektɪv/ (n. 观点).

"The question isn't how much money we have," she told her team. "It's how we measure **growth** /ɡroʊθ/ (n. 成长). Do we count only the **amount** /əˈmaʊnt/ (n. 数量) of buildings, or do we count families who can afford to stay?" Her **contemporary** /kənˈtempəreri/ (adj. 当代的) **style** /staɪl/ (n. 风格) of leadership—direct but compassionate—resonated with voters.

As the sun set, Maya received word: a major endorsement from environmental groups. **Tomorrow** /təˈmɔːroʊ/ (adv. 明天), she would announce the news. But tonight, she simply felt grateful. Victory wasn't about **re-election**; it was about staying true to values. And that truth would never **lie** /laɪ/ (v. 说谎；躺) dormant **in** her heart.

## Part 2. 故事翻译 (中文)

竞选连任办公室里充满了能量。玛雅·罗德里格斯正在竞选她的第二任市长任期,她在早餐时审阅民意调查。数字显示她的影响力增长了,但来自西方商业利益集团的反对也在增长,他们想超越环境限制。

"我们需要对胜利有一个明确的定义,"她的竞选经理边倒咖啡边说。"赢是什么样子?"玛雅仔细思考。拥有这个职位意味着的不仅仅是选票——它意味着保护对社区至关重要的东西。

那天早晨,一道记忆的闪光把玛雅带回了童年。她记起祖母留在日记中的书面建议:"永远不要让恐惧干涉做正确的事。带来希望,而不是你无法兑现的承诺。"

温暖的微风从窗户飘进来,玛雅准备面对这一天的挑战。她在自己的施政纲领中增加了一项新提案:绿色工作岗位与经济适用房的结合。批评者说她会失去商业支持,但玛雅从不同的角度看待这个问题。

"问题不在于我们有多少钱,"她告诉团队。"而在于我们如何衡量成长。我们只计算建筑物的数量,还是计算能够负担得起留下来的家庭?"她当代的领导风格——直接但富有同情心——引起了选民的共鸣。

日落时分,玛雅收到消息:获得了环保组织的重要支持。明天,她将宣布这个消息。但今晚,她只是感到感恩。胜利不在于连任;而在于忠于价值观。这个真理永远不会在她心中沉睡。

## Part 4. 重点句讲解

### 句子 1
**原句:** "Owning this position meant more than votes—it meant protecting what was vital to the community."

**分析:** 动名词 "Owning" 作主语。破折号用来引出进一步的解释。"what was vital" 是名词性从句作 "protecting" 的宾语。

**亮点:** 通过对比"选票"与"保护重要事物",展现了领导者的深层责任感。

---

### 句子 2
**原句:** "Never let fear interfere with doing right. Bring hope, not promises you can't keep."

**分析:** 祈使句表达建议或命令。"let + 宾语 + 动词原形" 是使役动词用法。"promises you can't keep" 中的定语从句修饰 promises。

**亮点:** 简洁有力的道德箴言,适合作为人生格言,体现了智慧的传承。

---

### 句子 3
**原句:** "Do we count only the amount of buildings, or do we count families who can afford to stay?"

**分析:** 并列疑问句,用 "or" 连接两个选择。反问句式引发思考,比陈述句更有力。

**亮点:** 通过对比"建筑数量"与"家庭",将抽象的政策讨论具体化、人性化。

---

### 句子 4
**原句:** "Her contemporary style of leadership—direct but compassionate—resonated with voters."

**分析:** 破折号中间插入的 "direct but compassionate" 是同位语,进一步解释 "style"。"resonate with" 是固定搭配,意为"引起共鸣"。

**亮点:** 用具体形容词刻画领导风格,让人物形象更立体。

---

## Part 5. 语法聚焦 (Grammar Focus)

### 聚焦点 1: 动名词作主语

**原句:** "Owning this position meant more than votes."

**聚焦:** 动名词 (Gerund) 作主语

**用法说明:**
动名词(动词-ing形式)可以作主语,表示一般性的行为或概念。这种用法比不定式 (to own) 更常见,更自然。

**结构对比:**
- 动名词作主语: "Owning a house is expensive." (一般陈述)
- 不定式作主语: "To own a house is my dream." (强调目的或特定情况)

**更多例句:**
- "Learning languages takes time."
- "Swimming is good exercise."

**可替换句:** "To own this position meant more than votes." (较不自然,但语法正确)

---

### 聚焦点 2: "let + 宾语 + 动词原形" 使役动词

**原句:** "Never let fear interfere with doing right."

**聚焦:** let 作使役动词的用法

**用法说明:**
"let" 是使役动词,后接宾语和不带 "to" 的不定式(动词原形),表示"让、允许某人做某事"。否定形式 "don't let" 或 "never let" 表示"不要让"。

**使役动词对比:**
- let: "Let me help you." (允许,较主动)
- make: "They made me wait." (强迫)
- have: "I'll have him call you." (安排、要求)

**可替换句:** "Never allow fear to interfere with doing right." (用 "allow" 需要加 "to")
