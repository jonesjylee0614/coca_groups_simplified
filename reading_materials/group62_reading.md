## 📖 Reading Passage

The **musician** sat in his **mobile** studio, **worried** about the upcoming **appointment**. His **fate** seemed **tight** – the **establishment** wanted to **alter** his **organic** sound into something more **commercial**. But his **pride** wouldn't **adapt** so **rapidly**.

"**Plus**, I need creative **freedom**," he told the **congressman** who'd become his **surprising** **ally**. The **dialogue** continued through the **shower** of **external** **pressure**. **Mainly**, he wanted to **favor** **artistic** **integrity** over **market** **demands**.

The **celebrity** **status** brought **obligation**s. **Taxpayer**-funded venues, **infrastructure** for tours, **diverse** audiences – all required **balance**. But **publicly**, he maintained his **stance**: **extraordinary** art couldn't be **random** or **absolute**ly **commercial**.

In his **clothing** store **appearance**, fans would **tap** his shoulder, **impress**ed by his **principles**. The **frequency** of such **encounters** proved his **approach** **worked**. He'd **convert** **doubters** through **music**, not **compromise**.

"**Bye** to **conventional** paths," he declared. His **domain** was **authentic** expression. The **ceiling** of **possibility** kept **rising**. **Shopping** for **bell**s and **unique** **instruments** at **diverse** **port** markets, he **maintained** his **vision**.

The **establishment** **eventually** **understood**: true **art** required **shelter** from **pure** **commercialism**. His **fate** wasn't to **beg** for **approval**, but to **lead** through **extraordinary** **creation**. **Asleep** or **awake**, his **intellectual** **pride** guided every **decision**.
