## 📖 Reading Passage: The Flight to Freedom

Last **January**, Emma sat in her small **apartment** looking at her **favorite** travel **website**. She had **currently** been living in the same place for three years, and she felt the **limit**s of her routine life. **Yesterday**, she had decided to make a change. She wanted to take a **flight** to **somewhere** new, **somewhere** where she could **appreciate** the beauty of different **climate**s and cultures.

Emma worked as a tour guide, but she had never traveled beyond her city's **border**. She would **present** information about local history to **guest**s, but she secretly dreamed of exploring distant lands. Her **attitude** was changing - she was becoming more aware of what she wanted from life.

"I need to **start** planning **seriously**," Emma told herself. She began to **observe** flight prices and **reading** about different destinations. The **volume** of information was overwhelming at first, but she was determined. She wanted to **survive** her fears and **fix** her **negative** **attitude** about taking risks.

Emma's **chief** concern was money. She needed to **appreciate** her **current** financial situation before making any decisions. She sat down with a calculator to **observe** her savings. The **actual** amount was less than she hoped, but **it** wasn't impossible. She would need to make a plan and stick to **it** **until** she had enough.

"I **am** going to do this," she said out loud. She felt a sudden surge of energy. The **relation** between her dreams and her actions was becoming clearer. She **currently** had about three **hundred** dollars saved, but she would need at least five **hundred** for a simple trip.

Emma decided to **connect** with her friend Sarah, who worked in **leadership** at a travel agency. Sarah could offer **advice** on how to make the trip affordable. They met at a café near Emma's **apartment**.

"I want to **appreciate** your help," Emma said as they sat down. "I've been thinking about this **seriously**. I need a change."

Sarah smiled warmly. "I **appreciate** your honesty," she said. "Let me **observe** some options. What kind of **climate** do you prefer? **Fun** adventures or **regular** sightseeing?"

Emma thought for a moment. "I want to **survive** outside my comfort zone," she said. "Maybe **somewhere** with a different **climate**, where I can **appreciate** nature and have some **fun**. But nothing too **dangerous**."

Sarah pulled out her tablet and showed Emma several options. There was a coastal town with a **boat** tour, a mountain **region** with hiking trails, and a desert area with unique **aspect**s of culture. Each option had its own appeal.

"The coastal **flight** is your best option in **terms** of cost," Sarah explained. "**It**'s **currently** on sale, and you can stay with a **guest** house that's very affordable. The **relation** between quality and price is excellent there."

Emma felt excited. She began to **appreciate** how **possible** this trip was becoming. She decided to **grab** the opportunity. "Let's book **it**," she said. "I **am** **seriously** ready for this."

Over the next few weeks, Emma worked extra hours to increase her savings. She would **wake** up early and **start** her day with renewed energy. Her **attitude** had completely changed. She no longer felt the **limit**s of her **current** situation as restrictions but as challenges to overcome.

**Until** the day of her **flight** arrived, Emma prepared **complete**ly. She packed her bags, checked her **present** documents, and made sure she had everything she needed. She felt both nervous and excited. This was a **complete** departure from her **regular** life.

As Emma sat on the **flight**, she looked out the window and saw the **crowd** of **cloud**s below. She felt her **soul** expanding. She was no longer just talking about travel as a **guest** guide - she was experiencing **it** herself. The **relation** between talking about life and living **it** was profound.

When she arrived at her **destination**, Emma took a **boat** out to **observe** the ocean. The **climate** was perfect - warm but not too hot. The **distance** from her old life felt healing. She could **appreciate** the **protection** of nature, the **intelligence** of the local people who knew how to live in harmony with their environment.

Emma met a local woman named Maria who ran the **guest** house. Maria had survived many **attack**s on her business over the years - economic downturns, natural disasters, and other **challenges**. But she had maintained a positive **attitude** and never gave up.

"Life will test you," Maria said as they sat watching the sunset. "But you must never **deny** your dreams. You must **appreciate** what you have while always reaching for more. That's the **key** to happiness."

Emma felt tears in her eyes. She had come to this place to **survive** her own fears, and here she was learning about real **survive**al. Maria's words touched her **soul**.

Over the next few days, Emma explored the **area**. She took a **boat** to a nearby island, hiked along the **border** between the forest and the beach, and learned about the local **climate** and ecosystem. She met other **guest**s who shared their own stories of travel and transformation.

**One** evening, Emma sat on the beach and reflected on her journey. She had **deny**ied herself this experience for so long, always finding reasons why **it** wasn't the right time. But now, sitting here in this beautiful place, she **appreciate**d how important **it** was to take action.

She thought about her **current** life and her future. She realized that the **limit**s she had felt were mostly in her mind. The **actual** **limit**s were much smaller than she had imagined. She had the **intelligence** and the courage to create the life she wanted.

Emma decided to **fix** her **negative** thinking patterns once she returned home. She would **start** viewing her job differently. Instead of feeling **limit**ed as a local guide, she would **appreciate** the **aspect** of sharing knowledge. She would also plan **regular** trips to **maintain** her sense of adventure.

As her trip came to an end, Emma sat down to write in her journal. She wanted to **present** her thoughts **complete**ly and honestly. She wrote about her fears, her joys, and the **lesson**s she had learned. She wrote about how **it** felt to **survive** her doubts and to **appreciate** life more **fully**.

On the **flight** home, Emma looked out at the **crowd** of **cloud**s again. She felt different. The **distance** she had traveled wasn't just physical - **it** was emotional and spiritual too. She had **connect**ed with her true self and her true desires.

When Emma returned to her **apartment**, everything looked the same, but she had changed. She **appreciate**d her space differently now. She could see **it** not as a **limit**ation but as a **present** blessing - a safe place to **start** from and to return to.

Emma **currently** continues to work as a tour guide, but with a new **attitude**. She brings the **intelligence** and **appreciate**ion she gained from her travels to every tour. She encourages her **guest**s to take their own adventures, to not **limit** themselves, to **appreciate** every moment.

She also plans a trip every **January** now, making **it** a **regular** tradition. Each time, she chooses **somewhere** different, **somewhere** that will challenge her and help her grow. She has learned that life is not about **survive**ing but about truly living, about **appreciate**ing every **aspect** of the journey.

Emma's story reminds us that sometimes we need to **fly** away from our comfort zones to **appreciate** what we have and to **observe** what else is **possible**. The **limit**s we feel are often just walls we've built ourselves. When we have the courage to **grab** opportunities and to **fix** our **negative** thoughts, we discover that life has so much more to offer.

## 📖 中文翻译 (Chinese Translation)

### 飞向自由

去年一月,艾玛坐在她的小公寓里浏览她最喜欢的旅游网站。她目前已经在同一个地方生活了三年,她感到自己日常生活的局限性。昨天,她决定做出改变。她想飞往某个新地方,某个她可以欣赏不同气候和文化之美的地方。

艾玛是一名导游,但她从未到过城市边界之外的地方旅行。她会向客人介绍当地历史信息,但她暗自梦想着探索遥远的土地。她的态度正在改变——她越来越意识到自己想从生活中得到什么。

"我需要认真开始规划,"艾玛对自己说。她开始观察航班价格并阅读关于不同目的地的信息。信息量一开始让人不知所措,但她很坚定。她想要克服恐惧,修复她对冒险的消极态度。

艾玛的主要担忧是钱。在做任何决定之前,她需要认识到自己目前的财务状况。她坐下来用计算器观察她的储蓄。实际金额比她希望的要少,但并非不可能。她需要制定一个计划并坚持下去,直到她有足够的钱。

"我要做这件事,"她大声说道。她感到突然涌起一股能量。她的梦想和行动之间的关系变得越来越清晰。她目前大约存了三百美元,但简单的旅行至少需要五百美元。

艾玛决定联系她的朋友莎拉,她在一家旅行社担任领导职务。莎拉可以就如何使旅行负担得起提供建议。他们在艾玛公寓附近的一家咖啡馆见面。

"我想感谢你的帮助,"他们坐下时艾玛说。"我一直在认真考虑这件事。我需要改变。"

莎拉温暖地微笑着。"我欣赏你的诚实,"她说。"让我观察一些选项。你喜欢什么样的气候?有趣的冒险还是常规观光?"

艾玛思考了一会儿。"我想要走出舒适区,"她说。"也许是气候不同的地方,在那里我可以欣赏大自然并获得一些乐趣。但不要太危险。"

莎拉拿出她的平板电脑,给艾玛展示了几个选项。有一个海滨小镇有船游,一个有徒步小径的山区,还有一个具有独特文化方面的沙漠地区。每个选项都有自己的吸引力。

"就成本而言,海滨航班是你最好的选择,"莎拉解释道。"它目前正在打折,你可以住在一个非常实惠的宾馆。那里的质量和价格之间的关系非常好。"

艾玛感到兴奋。她开始意识到这次旅行是多么可能。她决定抓住这个机会。"让我们预订吧,"她说。"我真的准备好了。"

在接下来的几周里,艾玛加班工作以增加储蓄。她会早起,以崭新的能量开始她的一天。她的态度完全改变了。她不再把目前情况的限制视为束缚,而是视为要克服的挑战。

直到她航班的那天到来,艾玛完全准备好了。她打包行李,检查她现有的文件,确保她拥有所需的一切。她既紧张又兴奋。这是对她常规生活的彻底背离。

当艾玛坐在航班上时,她望向窗外,看到下面的云层。她感到她的灵魂在扩展。她不再只是作为客座导游谈论旅行——她正在亲身体验它。谈论生活和生活之间的关系是深刻的。

当她到达目的地时,艾玛乘船出海观察海洋。气候完美——温暖但不太热。与旧生活的距离让她感到治愈。她可以欣赏大自然的保护,欣赏当地人如何与环境和谐相处的智慧。

艾玛遇到了一位经营宾馆的当地女性玛丽亚。玛丽亚多年来经历了对她生意的许多打击——经济衰退、自然灾害和其他挑战。但她保持着积极的态度,从未放弃。

"生活会考验你,"玛丽亚说,他们坐着看日落。"但你决不能否认你的梦想。你必须欣赏你所拥有的,同时总是追求更多。这就是幸福的关键。"

艾玛眼中含着泪水。她来到这个地方是为了克服自己的恐惧,而在这里她正在学习真正的生存。玛丽亚的话触动了她的灵魂。

在接下来的几天里,艾玛探索了这个地区。她乘船去了附近的一个岛屿,沿着森林和海滩之间的边界徒步旅行,并了解了当地的气候和生态系统。她遇到了其他客人,他们分享了自己关于旅行和转变的故事。

一天晚上,艾玛坐在海滩上反思她的旅程。她曾经否认自己这种经历这么长时间,总是找理由说现在不是合适的时间。但现在,坐在这个美丽的地方,她意识到采取行动是多么重要。

她思考着自己目前的生活和未来。她意识到她感受到的限制大多在她的脑海中。实际的限制比她想象的要小得多。她有智慧和勇气去创造她想要的生活。

艾玛决定回家后修复她的消极思维模式。她会开始以不同的方式看待她的工作。她不会再觉得作为当地导游受到限制,而是会欣赏分享知识的一面。她还会计划定期旅行以保持她的冒险感。

当她的旅行即将结束时,艾玛坐下来写日记。她想完整而诚实地呈现她的想法。她写下了她的恐惧、她的快乐以及她学到的教训。她写下了克服疑虑和更充分地欣赏生活的感受。

在回家的航班上,艾玛再次望向云层。她感觉不同了。她旅行的距离不仅仅是物理上的——它也是情感和精神上的。她与自己的真实自我和真实愿望建立了联系。

当艾玛回到她的公寓时,一切看起来都一样,但她变了。她现在以不同的方式欣赏她的空间。她不再将它视为限制,而是视为目前的祝福——一个可以出发和回归的安全之地。

艾玛目前继续担任导游,但态度焕然一新。她将从旅行中获得的智慧和欣赏带到每次旅行中。她鼓励她的客人进行自己的冒险,不要限制自己,欣赏每一刻。

她现在每年一月还会计划一次旅行,使之成为常规传统。每次,她都会选择不同的地方,一个会挑战她并帮助她成长的地方。她学到了生活不是关于生存,而是关于真正地生活,关于欣赏旅程的每一个方面。

艾玛的故事提醒我们,有时我们需要飞离我们的舒适区来欣赏我们所拥有的,并观察还有什么可能。我们感受到的限制通常只是我们自己建造的墙。当我们有勇气抓住机会并修复我们的消极思想时,我们会发现生活有如此多的东西可以提供。
