## 📖 Reading Passage: Coming Home

After **five** **years** **away**, Michael was **finally** **coming** **home**. The **plane** **came** down **through** the **clouds**, and he **saw** his **city** **below** – the **place** **where** he'd **grown** up, the **home** he'd **left** **behind**.

"Are you **ready** to **come** **back**?" his **sister** **asked** **over** the **phone**.

"I **think** so," Michael **replied**. "I've **come** a **long** **way**, but **home** **never** really **left** my **heart**."

When **people** **asked** **him** **why** he'd **left**, he **always** **gave** the **same** **answer**: "I **wanted** to **see** what **else** was out **there**." And he **had** **seen** many **things** – **different** **cities**, **different** **cultures**, **different** **ways** of **life**.

But **now**, **coming** **back**, he **realized** **something**: **home** **wasn't** **just** a **place**. It was the **people** **who** **knew** you, the **memories** that **shaped** you, the **roots** that **held** you **even** when you **went** **away**.

The **taxi** **came** to his **old** **neighborhood**. **Everything** **looked** the **same**, yet **different**. The **corner** **store** **where** he **used** to **buy** **candy** was **still** **there**. The **park** **where** he'd **played** as a **child** **hadn't** **changed**.

His **family** **came** out to **greet** him. His **mother** **cried**. His **father** **smiled**. His **sister** **hugged** him **tight**.

"**Welcome** **home**," they **said**.

Michael **realized** that **coming** **home** **wasn't** about the **place** – it was about **coming** **back** to the **people** **who** **loved** you. **Home** was **where** you **came** **from**, but **also** **where** you could **always** **come** **back** to.

"It's **good** to be **home**," he **said**. And he **meant** it.

**Coming** **back** **after** **five** **years** **away**, Michael **understood**: you could **leave** **home**, but **home** **never** really **left** you. It **came** with you **wherever** you **went**, **waiting** for the **day** you'd **come** **back**.

And when you **finally** **came** **home**, it was like you'd **never** **left** at all.
