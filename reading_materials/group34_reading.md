## 📖 Reading Passage: Taking Action

"**Action** speaks **louder** than **words**," Coach **Johnson** **always** **said**. His **team** **knew** he **meant** it.

One day, a new **player** joined the **team**. He **talked** **a** **lot** about his **skills**, about what he **could** do, about how **good** he was. But when **practice** **started**, his **actions** **didn't** **match** his **words**.

"**Take** your **talk** and **turn** it **into** **action**," Coach **Johnson** **told** him **after** **practice**. "I don't **care** what you **say** you **can** do. **Show** me what you **actually** **can** do."

The **player** was **surprised**. At his **old** **school**, **talking** had been **enough**. But here, **action** was what **mattered**.

He **decided** to **change**. **Instead** of **talking** about **practicing**, he **actually** **practiced**. **Instead** of **saying** he'd **improve**, he **took** **action** to **improve**. **Instead** of **promising** he'd be **better**, he **worked** to **actually** **be** **better**.

**Slowly**, his **teammates** **noticed**. "He's **different** now," they **said**. "He's **taking** **real** **action**."

Coach **Johnson** **saw** the **change** **too**. "**Now** you're **learning**," he **told** the **player**. "**Words** are **easy**. **Action** is **hard**. But **action** is what **creates** **real** **change**."

The **player** **understood** now. **Talk** was **cheap**. **Action** was **valuable**. If you **wanted** to **achieve** **something**, you had to **take** **action**, not just **talk** about it.

"**Take** one **step**. Then **another**. Then **another**," Coach **Johnson** **taught**. "**That**'s how **action** **works**. One **step** **at** a **time**."
