## 📖 Reading Passage: The **Passing** of Old Ways

In a **neutral** **position** in the countryside, there was a small **pond** where people would **gather** during summer evenings. This was a place where the old ways seemed to **cease** and new ideas would **stem** from open conversations. The **gathering** spot was **beloved** by everyone, from the elderly who **preach**ed wisdom to children who would **kick** a ball near the water.

Marcus was a young man who had **left** the city to **stay** with his grandmother for the summer. He watched as the **passing** days brought changes to the village. Some traditions seemed to **vanish**, **passing** into memory like smoke in the wind. His grandmother would **feed** him stories about the old times while they sat by the **pond**, watching the **sunlight** reflect on the water.

The village had recently held a **survey** to understand what people wanted for the future. The results were interesting - a **combined** effort was **required** to preserve some traditions while allowing **emerging** new ideas. The town council needed to **authorize** changes, but they wanted to do it **firmly** yet fairly, not in a **poorly** planned way.

One evening at the **gathering**, an old man began to **preach** about the importance of maintaining their culture. "We cannot let our ways **vanish**," he said **firmly**. "We must not be **anxious** about change, but we must not **cease** to remember who we are." His words were powerful, though some younger people thought his **stance** was too conservative.

Marcus found himself in a **neutral** **position**. He could see both sides. The old ways were **beloved**, yes, but the village also needed to adapt. **Capitalism** was changing the economy. Young people were moving away because there were no opportunities. If nothing changed, the **removal** of the entire younger generation seemed likely.

The next day, Marcus decided to **survey** the situation more carefully. He walked around the **residential** area, talking to people. An **arab** merchant who ran a local **vendor** stall spoke about his experience. "I came here years ago," he said. "The village welcomed me. They didn't **interfere** with my business. This openness is what makes this place special."

Marcus learned that the village had once held a vote to **authorize** the **vendor** market. Some people had been **anxious** about allowing outside merchants, fearing they would compete with local businesses. But the **combined** market had actually helped everyone - it brought more visitors, more trade, and more **prosperity**.

At the **pond**, Marcus watched children play. One boy was drawing with a **fork** in the mud, creating patterns. Another was trying to **kick** stones across the water. Their joy was simple and pure. Marcus realized that what needed to be preserved wasn't specific traditions, but the **spirit** of community and simple happiness.

That evening, a **gathering** was called. The topic was whether to **authorize** a new development project. A **vendor** had proposed building a small **resort** near the **pond**. Some people loved the idea - it would bring jobs and money. Others hated it - they feared the **pond** would be ruined, that their **beloved** **gathering** spot would **vanish**.

The debate was intense. One woman spoke **openly** about her fears: "If we allow this, where does it end? Will we watch our village **vanish** into just another **tourist** trap?" Her voice carried genuine **anxiety**. A young man countered **firmly**: "If we don't adapt, we'll watch our young people **vanish** instead. The **passing** of our youth to the cities will **cease** to be a trickle and become a flood."

Marcus's grandmother, who rarely spoke at **gatherings**, stood up. Everyone turned to listen. "**Passing** judgment on either side is easy," she began. "But true wisdom requires us to **cease** thinking in extremes. We must **conceive** of a path that honors both old and new."

She suggested a **compromise**: **authorize** the development, but with strict rules. The **pond** must remain public. The development must be small-scale and **blend** with the environment. Local **vendors** must have priority in any business opportunities. The **removal** of trees must be **minimal**. "Let us not be **anxious**," she said. "Let us be **thoughtful**."

Her words had an effect. People nodded. The **illusion** that they had to choose one extreme or the other began to **vanish**. A **neutral** path was possible. The town council agreed to **survey** the land carefully, to **clarify** the rules, and to ensure any development would truly benefit everyone.

Marcus felt proud of his grandmother. She had shown that wisdom wasn't about **preaching** loudly or taking a **rigid** **stance**. It was about **openly** considering all perspectives and finding a way forward. Her **position** was both **firm** and **flexible** - **firmly** committed to the community's wellbeing, but flexible about the methods.

In the **meantime**, life continued. The **vendor** market thrived. Children played by the **pond**. The **sunlight** continued to **illuminate** the water each evening. The **passing** seasons brought their changes, but the core of community life remained strong.

Marcus learned to help his grandmother **feed** the chickens each morning. The **fever** of city life seemed far away now. Here, by the **pond**, watching the **passing** clouds, he felt **peace**. The **illusion** that happiness required **constant** excitement had begun to **vanish**.

One day, an unusual visitor arrived - a **cartoonist** from the city who wanted to create a **graphic** novel about village life. Some people were **suspicious**, worried this outsider would **portray** them **poorly**. But the artist was respectful, spending weeks just **observing** and **listening**. She would sit by the **pond**, sketching, never **interfering** with people's lives.

Her **cartoon** series, when published, was **beautiful**. It showed the village not as a **backward** place, but as a community where people lived **openly** and **authentically**. The **graphic** style was **modern**, but the **emotions** were **universal**. The series became **popular**, bringing positive attention to the village.

This **popularity** had effects. More **vendors** wanted to set up stalls. More tourists came to visit. The town council had to make a **position** statement - they would **authorize** growth, but **slowly** and **carefully**. The **removal** of the village's character was not **acceptable**. Any changes **required** community approval.

Marcus watched all this with interest. He realized he was witnessing the **stem** of a new era. The old ways weren't **vanishing** - they were **transforming**. The **pond** was still **beloved**, but now it was also a **symbol** of the village's ability to **balance** tradition and change.

His grandmother explained it well: "**Passing** wisdom to the next generation doesn't mean making them **copies** of us. It means teaching them to **conceive** their own solutions, to not **hesitate** when action is needed, but to not **rush** either."

The development project eventually went forward, but in a **modified** form. The **vendor** who proposed it worked **firmly** but **fairly** with the community. Local people were **hired**. The **pond** remained **accessible**. The **gathering** space was actually **improved**, with better **seating** and **lighting** while keeping its **natural** character.

Marcus's **position** evolved through this experience. He came to the village thinking city life was **superior**. He began to see that different places had different **strengths**. The **capitalism** of the city created **wealth**, but the **community** spirit of the village created **happiness**. Neither was **purely** better - both had **merit**.

By summer's end, Marcus didn't want to leave. But he knew he must. As he prepared his **departure**, his grandmother gave him advice: "Don't let the **fever** of ambition make you **anxious**. Don't let **racism** or prejudice **cloud** your judgment. **Stay** true to yourself, but **openly** learn from others. **Feed** your mind and your **spirit** equally."

Standing by the **pond** one last time, Marcus felt the **sunlight** on his face. The water was calm, **neutral**, reflecting the sky. Children were **passing** by, **laughing**. **Vendors** were closing their stalls. The day was **passing** into evening.

He thought about how the word "**passing**" had so many meanings. Time was **passing**. Seasons were **passing**. Knowledge was **passing** from old to young. Some things were **passing** away, **vanishing** forever. But other things were **passing** through, **staying** in new forms.

The **illusion** that change meant **loss** had **vanished** from Marcus's mind. He now understood that the question wasn't whether to **authorize** change or to **resist** it. The question was how to **guide** change so it **served** the community's true needs.

As the **shuttle** arrived to take him back to the city, Marcus made a promise. He would **stay** connected to the village. He would not let this **beloved** place **vanish** from his life. He would **feed** his memories of this summer, and perhaps one day, he would return to **stay** permanently.

The **pond** remained, as it always had. The **sunlight** played on its **surface**. The **passing** visitor had become a **friend**. And somewhere, in the **neutral** space between old and new, tradition and change, the village had found its path forward - **firmly** rooted in its past, but **openly** facing its future.

## 📖 中文翻译 (Chinese Translation)

### 旧方式的消逝

在乡村的中立位置,有一个小池塘,人们在夏日傍晚会聚集在这里。这是一个旧方式似乎停止、新想法从开放对话中产生的地方。这个聚会地点深受每个人喜爱,从宣讲智慧的老人到在水边踢球的孩子们。

马库斯是一个年轻人,他离开城市来与祖母度过夏天。他看着逝去的日子给村庄带来变化。一些传统似乎消失了,像烟雾一样消逝在记忆中。祖母会在他们坐在池塘边时给他讲述旧时光的故事,看着阳光在水面上反射。

村庄最近进行了一项调查,以了解人们对未来的期望。结果很有趣——需要共同努力来保存一些传统,同时允许新想法的出现。镇议会需要授权变革,但他们想要坚定而公平地做,而不是计划不周。

一天晚上在聚会上,一位老人开始宣讲维护他们文化的重要性。"我们不能让我们的方式消失,"他坚定地说。"我们不应该对变化感到焦虑,但我们不能停止记住我们是谁。"他的话很有力量,尽管一些年轻人认为他的立场太保守了。

马库斯发现自己处于中立立场。他能看到双方。旧方式是受人喜爱的,是的,但村庄也需要适应。资本主义正在改变经济。年轻人因为没有机会而搬走。如果什么都不改变,整个年轻一代的离开似乎很可能。

第二天,马库斯决定更仔细地调查情况。他走遍住宅区,与人们交谈。一位经营当地小摊的阿拉伯商人谈到了他的经历。"我几年前来到这里,"他说。"村庄欢迎我。他们没有干涉我的生意。这种开放性是让这个地方特别的原因。"

马库斯了解到,村庄曾经投票授权小贩市场。一些人对允许外来商人感到焦虑,担心他们会与当地企业竞争。但联合市场实际上帮助了每个人——它带来了更多游客、更多贸易和更多繁荣。

在池塘边,马库斯看着孩子们玩耍。一个男孩用叉子在泥里画画,创造图案。另一个试图把石头踢过水面。他们的快乐简单而纯粹。马库斯意识到,需要保存的不是具体的传统,而是社区和简单快乐的精神。

那天晚上,召开了一次聚会。主题是是否授权一个新的开发项目。一位小贩提议在池塘附近建一个小度假村。有些人喜欢这个想法——它会带来工作和金钱。其他人讨厌它——他们担心池塘会被毁,他们心爱的聚会地点会消失。

辩论很激烈。一位女士公开谈论她的恐惧:"如果我们允许这个,它会在哪里结束?我们会看着我们的村庄消失成为另一个旅游陷阱吗?"她的声音带着真正的焦虑。一位年轻人坚定地反驳:"如果我们不适应,我们将看着我们的年轻人消失。我们年轻人向城市的流逝将不再是涓涓细流,而会成为洪流。"

马库斯的祖母很少在聚会上发言,站了起来。每个人都转身听。"对任何一方做出评判都很容易,"她开始说。"但真正的智慧要求我们停止极端思考。我们必须构思一条既尊重旧事物又接受新事物的道路。"

她建议妥协:授权开发,但要有严格的规则。池塘必须保持公共。开发必须是小规模的,并与环境融合。当地小贩必须在任何商业机会中优先。树木的清除必须最少。"让我们不要焦虑,"她说。"让我们深思熟虑。"

她的话产生了影响。人们点头。他们必须选择一个极端或另一个极端的幻觉开始消失。中立道路是可能的。镇议会同意仔细调查土地,明确规则,并确保任何开发都真正惠及每个人。

马库斯为他的祖母感到骄傲。她展示了智慧不是大声宣讲或采取僵化立场。而是公开考虑所有观点并找到前进的道路。她的立场既坚定又灵活——坚定地致力于社区福祉,但对方法保持灵活。

与此同时,生活继续。小贩市场繁荣。孩子们在池塘边玩耍。阳光每晚继续照亮水面。逝去的季节带来了变化,但社区生活的核心保持强大。

马库斯学会了每天早上帮祖母喂鸡。城市生活的狂热似乎很遥远了。在这里,在池塘边,看着流逝的云彩,他感到平静。幸福需要持续兴奋的幻觉开始消失。

一天,一位不寻常的访客到来了——一位来自城市的漫画家,想创作一部关于村庄生活的图画小说。有些人很怀疑,担心这个外人会把他们描绘得很差。但这位艺术家很尊重,花了几周时间只是观察和倾听。她会坐在池塘边素描,从不干涉人们的生活。

她的漫画系列出版后很美。它展示的村庄不是一个落后的地方,而是一个人们公开真实生活的社区。图画风格是现代的,但情感是普遍的。这个系列变得受欢迎,为村庄带来了积极的关注。

这种受欢迎程度产生了影响。更多小贩想要设摊。更多游客来访问。镇议会不得不发表立场声明——他们会授权增长,但要缓慢而谨慎。村庄特色的消除是不可接受的。任何变化都需要社区批准。

马库斯饶有兴趣地看着这一切。他意识到他正在见证一个新时代的开端。旧方式没有消失——它们在转变。池塘仍然受人喜爱,但现在它也是村庄平衡传统和变革能力的象征。

他的祖母解释得很好:"把智慧传给下一代并不意味着让他们成为我们的复制品。这意味着教他们构思自己的解决方案,在需要行动时不犹豫,但也不要急于求成。"

开发项目最终以修改形式进行。提议的小贩坚定而公平地与社区合作。雇用了当地人。池塘保持可达性。聚会空间实际上得到了改善,有了更好的座位和照明,同时保持了自然特色。

马库斯的立场通过这次经历而演变。他来到村庄时认为城市生活更优越。他开始看到不同的地方有不同的优势。城市的资本主义创造财富,但村庄的社区精神创造幸福。两者都不是纯粹更好的——两者都有优点。

到夏天结束时,马库斯不想离开。但他知道他必须离开。当他准备离开时,祖母给了他建议:"不要让野心的狂热让你焦虑。不要让种族主义或偏见蒙蔽你的判断。保持真实的自己,但公开地向他人学习。同样滋养你的思想和精神。"

最后一次站在池塘边,马库斯感到阳光照在脸上。水面平静,中性,反射着天空。孩子们经过,笑着。小贩们正在关闭摊位。白天正在过渡到傍晚。

他想到"流逝"这个词有多少意义。时间在流逝。季节在流逝。知识从老到少传递。有些东西正在消逝,永远消失。但其他东西正在经过,以新形式停留。

变化意味着损失的幻觉已从马库斯的脑海中消失。他现在明白,问题不是授权变化还是抵制变化。问题是如何引导变化,使其服务于社区的真正需求。

当班车到达带他回城市时,马库斯做了一个承诺。他会与村庄保持联系。他不会让这个心爱的地方从他的生活中消失。他会滋养这个夏天的记忆,也许有一天,他会回来永久居住。

池塘依然存在,一如既往。阳光在其表面嬉戏。流逝的访客已成为朋友。在某个地方,在新旧之间、传统与变革之间的中立空间,村庄找到了前进的道路——坚定地扎根于过去,但公开地面对未来。
