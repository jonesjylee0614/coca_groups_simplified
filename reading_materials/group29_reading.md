## 📖 Reading Passage: The Long Journey

Maria's **journey** was **long**. She'd been **traveling** for **days**, **moving** from one **place** to **another**, **getting** **closer** to her **destination** but still so **far** **away**.

"**How** **much** **longer**?" she **asked** the **driver**.

"**Another** **few** **hours**," he **replied**. "But the **road** **gets** **better** **ahead**."

Maria **looked** out the **window**. The **road** **behind** was **rough**. The **journey** so **far** had been **difficult**. But **something** **inside** her **kept** **moving** her **forward**.

"**Why** are you **making** this **long** **journey**?" the **driver** **asked**.

"To **get** to **somewhere** I've **never** **been**," Maria **replied**. "**Somewhere** that **feels** like **where** I'm **meant** to be."

The **driver** **nodded**. "**Long** **journeys** **teach** us **things**. By the **time** we **arrive**, we're **different** from **when** we **started**."

Maria **thought** about this. She was **already** **different**. The **long** **road** had **changed** her. **Each** **mile**, **each** **hour**, **each** **challenge** had **shaped** who she was **becoming**.

**Hours** **passed**. The **journey** **continued**. **Long** **roads** **stretched** **ahead**. But Maria wasn't **tired** **anymore**. She **understood** now: the **journey** **itself** was **part** of the **destination**.

"We're **getting** **close**," the **driver** **said** **finally**.

Maria **smiled**. The **long** **journey** was **ending**. But in a **way**, it was just **beginning**. **Because** **every** **destination** was just the **start** of **another** **long** **journey**.

And that was okay. **Long** **journeys** were **worth** **taking**, as **long** as they **took** you **somewhere** **meaningful**.
