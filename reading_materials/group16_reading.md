## 📖 Reading Passage: The Environmental Protection Campaign

Last **summer**, our community decided to act on a **serious** environmental issue. The problem was clear: we were producing too much waste, and the **natural** environment around us was suffering. It was time to make a change.

The plan started when a group of students from our local high school decided to take action. They organized a campaign to raise awareness about environmental protection. The first step was to conduct an **analysis** of the current situation.

Dr. Smith, a professor at the nearby university, helped us with the research. He explained that we needed to **fill** the gap between what we knew and what we were doing. "The **amount** of waste we produce each day is **significant**," he said.

The campaign began with a simple idea: we would **help** everyone understand the importance of protecting the environment. Each person in the community would have a role to play.

One Saturday morning, we gathered at the community center. More than a hundred people showed up. We divided into groups and started to work. Some groups would focus on cleaning the local park, while others would **help** with the recycling program.

"This is going to be a long day," I said to my friend Maria, as we began to collect trash from the park.

"Yes, but it's worth it," she replied. "We need to **protect** the environment for future generations."

As we worked, I noticed that many people were surprised by the **amount** of waste we found. Plastic bottles, paper bags, and other materials were scattered everywhere. It was clear that we had a **serious** problem.

"We need to **store** this properly," said one of the workers. "We can't just throw everything **away**. We need to recycle what we can."

The **analysis** of the situation showed that we were producing about three times more waste than we should be. The **factor** that contributed most to this problem was the lack of awareness among the community members.

"We need to make a **statement**," said Dr. Smith. "We need to show that we care about the environment."

The campaign gained momentum as more people got involved. Local businesses started to support the initiative. They agreed to reduce the **amount** of plastic they used and to **help** with the recycling program.

One evening, we held a meeting at the community center. More than two hundred people attended. We discussed the **entire** plan and how we would implement it.

"The **entire** community needs to be involved," said the mayor. "We can't do this alone. We need everyone's **help**."

The **statement** we made was clear: we would work together to **protect** the environment. Each person would make a commitment to reduce their waste and to **help** with the recycling program.

As the weeks passed, we began to see the results. The **amount** of waste we produced decreased significantly. The park was cleaner, and the air was fresher.

"This is working," said Maria, as we walked through the park one evening. "The community is really coming together."

The **performance** of the campaign was better than we had expected. We had succeeded in raising awareness and in getting people to act.

One day, we visited a local **hospital** to learn about how they managed their waste. They had a system in **place** that we could learn from. The **hospital** administrator explained that they recycled more than seventy percent of their waste.

"We can do this too," I said. "We just need to be more organized."

The campaign continued throughout the **summer**. We organized weekly events to keep people engaged. We held workshops on recycling, composting, and other environmental topics.

"The **summer** has been great," said Dr. Smith. "We have made **significant** progress."

The **material** we used for the campaign was all recycled or recyclable. We wanted to lead by **example**. Each poster, each flyer, each banner was made from recycled paper.

As the campaign grew, we began to receive support from outside the community. A national environmental **agency** heard about our work and decided to **help**. They provided funding and expertise.

"This is amazing," said the mayor. "We never expected this kind of support."

The **century** we live in has brought many challenges, but it has also brought many opportunities. We have the **ability** to make a difference, and we are doing it.

One evening, we held a celebration at the park. Hundreds of people came to celebrate our success. We had music, food, and games. Most importantly, we had a sense of community.

"This is what it's all about," said Maria. "People working together to make the world a better **place**."

The **individual** efforts of each person had contributed to the success of the campaign. We had learned that when people come together, they can accomplish great things.

**Recently**, we received an award from the **state** government for our environmental work. It was a great honor, but it was also a reminder that we need to keep working.

"We can't stop now," said Dr. Smith. "We need to continue to work hard to **protect** the environment."

The **example** we set has inspired other communities to start their own environmental campaigns. We have shown that it is possible to make a difference.

The **state** government has decided to use our campaign as a model for other communities. They have asked us to **help** them develop a statewide program.

"This is incredible," said the mayor. "We started with a simple idea, and now we are helping to shape **state** policy."

The **place** where we started was small, but the impact we have had has been **significant**. We have shown that ordinary people can make extraordinary things happen.

The **animal** life in the park has improved as well. We have seen more birds, more squirrels, and more other animals since we started cleaning up the environment.

"The animals are coming back," said one of the workers. "This is a sign that we are doing something right."

We have learned that we cannot **fail** if we work together. The **factor** that makes the difference is commitment. Each person must be committed to the cause.

The **natural** environment around us is precious, and we must **protect** it. We have shown that it is possible to make a difference, and we will continue to work hard to **protect** the environment for future generations.

The **floor** of the community center was filled with people during our meetings. Each person had a chance to speak and to share their ideas.

The **serious** nature of the problem required a **serious** response. We couldn't just ignore it or hope that it would go **away**. We had to act.

The **career** of many people in the community was affected by the campaign. Some people decided to pursue careers in environmental science or in community organizing.

## 📖 中文翻译 (Chinese Translation)

### 环境保护运动

去年夏天，我们的社区决定对一个严重的环境问题采取行动。问题很清楚：我们产生的垃圾太多，我们周围的自然环境正在遭受损害。是时候做出改变了。

计划开始于我们当地高中一群学生决定采取行动的时候。他们组织了一次运动来提高人们对环境保护的认识。第一步是对当前情况进行分析。

史密斯博士是附近大学的一位教授，他帮助我们进行研究。他解释说我们需要填补我们所知道的和我们所做的之间的差距。"我们每天产生的垃圾量是显著的，"他说。

运动从一个简单的想法开始：我们将帮助每个人理解保护环境的重要性。社区中的每个人都将发挥作用。

一个星期六的早晨，我们聚集在社区中心。超过一百人出现了。我们分成小组开始工作。一些小组专注于清理当地公园，而其他小组将帮助回收计划。

"这将是一个漫长的一天，"当我和我的朋友玛丽亚开始从公园收集垃圾时，我对她说。

"是的，但这是值得的，"她回答说。"我们需要为后代保护环境。"

当我们工作时，我注意到许多人对我们发现的垃圾量感到惊讶。塑料瓶、纸袋和其他材料散落各处。很明显，我们有一个严重的问题。

"我们需要妥善储存这些，"其中一名工人说。"我们不能只是把一切都扔掉。我们需要回收我们能回收的东西。"

情况分析显示，我们产生的垃圾量是我们应该产生的三倍。导致这个问题的最主要因素是社区成员缺乏意识。

"我们需要发表声明，"史密斯博士说。"我们需要表明我们关心环境。"

随着越来越多的人参与，运动获得了动力。当地企业开始支持这项倡议。他们同意减少使用的塑料量，并帮助回收计划。

一天晚上，我们在社区中心举行了一次会议。超过两百人参加。我们讨论了整个计划以及我们将如何实施它。

"整个社区都需要参与，"市长说。"我们不能独自完成。我们需要每个人的帮助。"

我们发表的声明很清楚：我们将共同努力保护环境。每个人都将承诺减少他们的垃圾并帮助回收计划。

几周过去了，我们开始看到结果。我们产生的垃圾量显著减少。公园更干净了，空气更清新了。

"这正在起作用，"一天晚上当我们走过公园时，玛丽亚说。"社区真的团结在一起了。"

运动的表现在我们预期的要好。我们成功地提高了意识并让人们采取行动。

有一天，我们参观了当地一家医院，了解他们如何管理他们的垃圾。他们有一个我们可以学习的系统。医院管理员解释说，他们回收了超过百分之七十的垃圾。

"我们也能做到这一点，"我说。"我们只需要更有组织。"

运动在整个夏天继续进行。我们组织每周活动以保持人们的参与。我们举办了关于回收、堆肥和其他环境主题的研讨会。

"夏天很棒，"史密斯博士说。"我们取得了重大进展。"

我们用于运动的材料都是回收的或可回收的。我们想以身作则。每张海报、每张传单、每个横幅都是用回收纸制成的。

随着运动的发展，我们开始从社区外部获得支持。一个国家级环境机构听说了我们的工作，决定提供帮助。他们提供了资金和专业知识。

"这太棒了，"市长说。"我们从未期望过这种支持。"

我们生活的世纪带来了许多挑战，但也带来了许多机会。我们有能力做出改变，我们正在这样做。

一天晚上，我们在公园举行了庆祝活动。数百人前来庆祝我们的成功。我们有音乐、食物和游戏。最重要的是，我们有一种社区感。

"这就是全部的意义，"玛丽亚说。"人们共同努力使世界变得更美好。"

每个人的个人努力都促成了运动的成功。我们了解到，当人们聚集在一起时，他们可以完成伟大的事情。

最近，我们因环境工作获得了州政府的表彰。这是一个巨大的荣誉，但也是一个提醒，我们需要继续工作。

"我们现在不能停止，"史密斯博士说。"我们需要继续努力保护环境。"

我们树立的榜样激励了其他社区开始他们自己的环境运动。我们已经表明，做出改变是可能的。

州政府决定将我们的运动作为其他社区的模型。他们要求我们帮助他们制定一个全州范围的计划。

"这太不可思议了，"市长说。"我们从一个简单的想法开始，现在我们在帮助塑造州政策。"

我们开始的地方很小，但我们产生的影响是显著的。我们已经表明，普通人可以做出非凡的事情。

公园里的动物生活也得到了改善。自我们开始清理环境以来，我们看到了更多的鸟类、更多的松鼠和更多的其他动物。

"动物们回来了，"其中一名工人说。"这是一个迹象，表明我们正在做一些正确的事情。"

我们已经了解到，如果我们一起工作，我们就不会失败。起作用的因素是承诺。每个人都必须致力于这项事业。

我们周围的自然环境是珍贵的，我们必须保护它。我们已经表明，做出改变是可能的，我们将继续努力为后代保护环境。

领导国家机构的先生赞扬了我们的工作。他说我们为其他人树立了榜样。

该机构决定为我们的运动提供持续支持。他们将帮助我们扩大我们的计划并接触更多的人。

我们通常每月举行一次会议，讨论我们的进展并为未来做计划。每次会议都是学习和成长的机会。

我们做出改变的能力是显著的。我们已经表明，普通人可以完成非凡的事情，当他们一起工作时。

我们一起走过的里程很长，但这是值得的。我们已经创造了一些美好的东西，我们将继续努力保护它。

整个社区都从我们的工作中受益。空气更清洁，水更纯净，土地更健康。我们已经表明，做出改变是可能的。

我们用来做决定的民主过程很重要。我们想确保每个人在这个过程中都有发言权。

在我们会议期间，社区中心的地板上挤满了人。每个人都有机会发言并分享他们的想法。

问题的严重性需要一个严肃的回应。我们不能只是忽略它或希望它会消失。我们必须采取行动。

社区中许多人的职业生涯受到了运动的影响。一些人决定在环境科学或社区组织方面追求职业。

我们为运动筹集的美元金额是显著的。我们用它来购买设备、组织活动并支持我们正在进行的工作。

我们就继续运动进行的投票是一致的。每个人都同意我们应该继续努力保护环境。

参与者的性别并不重要。重要的是他们对事业的承诺。欢迎每个人参与。

我们继续将我们的结果与其他社区进行比较，看看我们做得如何。我们想确保我们在正确的轨道上。

其他社区的类似运动也取得了成功。这表明我们的方法是有效的，可以在其他地方复制。

环境团体大会认可了我们的工作。他们要求我们在他们的年度会议上介绍我们的运动。

对环境攻击必须停止。我们已经表明，反击并获胜是可能的。

过去的一年太棒了。我们完成了这么多，我们学到了这么多。我们为我们所取得的成就感到骄傲。

炎热的夏日并没有阻止我们工作。我们继续努力工作，知道我们的努力会有所作为。

我们寻求继续改进并扩大我们的计划。我们想接触更多的人并产生更大的影响。

保护环境是每个人的责任。我们已经表明，普通人可以做出改变，我们将继续努力为后代保护环境。
