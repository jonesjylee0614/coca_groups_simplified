## 📖 Reading Passage: The Forest Theater Mystery

On a cold **Tuesday** morning in **August**, Detective Chen arrived at the old **theater** in **front** of the **forest**. The **facility** had been closed for years, but **lots** of strange activity had been reported there recently. Someone was using the abandoned building, and the police needed to find out who.

Chen walked **slowly** through the main entrance, her footsteps echo ing on the wooden floor. The **theater** was dark and dusty. She could see the stage in **front** of her, where actors once performed for **lots** of people. Now **it** stood empty and silent, **below** faded curtains.

"I need to stay **aware** of everything," Chen thought. She had been **hire**d to investigate mysterious lights seen from the **forest** **multiple** times. Local residents were concerned. Some claimed to have seen someone moving **online** equipment into the **theater**. Others spoke of hearing strange music at night.

Chen **measure**d the distance from the entrance to the stage - about fifty feet. She walked **above** the old **theater** seats, examining every detail. She found a pair of **shoe** prints in the dust, leading towards the backstage area. Someone had definitely been here recently.

"I should **focus** on the backstage," Chen decided. She moved **slowly**, being careful not to disturb any evidence. As she walked, she thought about the case. The **theater** was located on **European** land donated by a wealthy family generations ago. **It** had once been the center of cultural life in the town.

Chen found a small room **below** the stage. Inside, she discovered **lots** of modern equipment - computers, **light**ing gear, and what appeared to be **online** streaming equipment. There was also a **poll** chart on the wall showing something about public opinion.

"This is interesting," Chen muttered. She took photos with her phone, being careful to **operate** **it** quietly. She didn't want to alert whoever was using this space. The equipment looked expensive and professional.

Chen **cross**ed to the other side of the backstage area. She found a desk with papers showing plans for a **presidential** **poll** and **division** of survey **area**s. There was also a document from an **institute** studying public opinion. **It** seemed someone was conducting secret research.

The detective's **mind** raced. This wasn't just someone using an abandoned **theater** for **fun**. This was a professional **operate**ion. She needed to understand the full picture before taking action. She decided to **settle** in and wait for someone to arrive.

Chen found a hiding **spot** **above** the stage, where she could see the entire **facility**. She checked her watch - **it** was still morning. She would need to be patient. She **focus**ed on staying **alert** and **aware**.

Hours passed **slowly**. The **winter** sun moved across the sky, sending **light** through broken windows. Chen remained still, her **mind** **focus**ed on the task. She had learned patience during her years in law enforcement. Sometimes you had to wait for the right moment.

**At** three o'clock, Chen heard footsteps. **Multiple** people entered the **theater**. She watched **slowly** from **above** as three individuals **cross**ed the main floor and headed backstage. They were carrying **lots** of equipment.

Chen listened carefully. The people were discussing a **poll** about the upcoming **presidential** election. They were trying to **measure** public opinion without official approval. They had **hire**d this secret **facility** to avoid **government** detection.

"We need to **operate** more carefully," one person said. "Someone might **become** **aware** of what we're doing."

"Don't worry," another replied. "This **theater** is perfect. No **one** comes to the **forest** anymore. We can **focus** on our work here."

Chen **slowly** moved to get a better **view**. She recognized one of the people - a researcher from the local **institute**. She also saw **online** streaming equipment being set up. They were planning to conduct a live **poll** and broadcast **it** **online** without permission.

The detective knew she had to act. This kind of unauthorized polling could affect the **presidential** election. She needed to **settle** this situation properly. She quietly called for backup, speaking in a low voice into her radio.

"**Guard** the exits," she whispered. "**Multiple** suspects inside. Conducting illegal **poll**ing **operate**ion."

Within minutes, other officers arrived. They moved **slowly** and quietly, positioning themselves at every exit. Chen gave the signal, and they moved in together. The suspects were surprised and had no time to escape.

"This **facility** is being used illegally," Chen announced. "You're conducting unauthorized **poll**ing activities. You need to come with us."

The researchers tried to explain. They said they were from a **European** **institute** studying **democratic** processes. They claimed they needed to **operate** secretly to get honest responses. They argued that official **poll**s were influenced by **government** pressure.

Chen listened but remained firm. "I understand your concerns," she said. "But you can't **operate** in secret **like** this. There are proper channels for conducting **poll**s. You need to **light** your activities through legitimate means, not hide in abandoned **theater**s."

The suspects were taken to the police station. Chen stayed behind to document everything. She **measure**d the space, photographed the equipment, and made detailed notes. The case would go to the **presidential** election **commission**.

As Chen locked up the **theater**, she looked at the old **facility** with new **appreciation**. **It** had once brought joy and culture to the community. Now **it** had been the site of an illegal **operate**ion. She hoped **it** could be restored and used properly again.

Walking back through the **forest**, Chen reflected on the case. She felt satisfied that she had **settle**d the **matter**. The illegal **poll**ing **operate**ion had been stopped. The **presidential** election would be protected from unauthorized influence.

**Tuesday** evenings in **August** were usually quiet, but tonight Chen had a **lot** of paperwork to complete. She drove back to the station, her **mind** still **focus**ed on the details. She would need to write a comprehensive report for the **commission**.

**At** the station, Chen's supervisor praised her work. "You showed excellent **awareness**," he said. "You didn't rush in. You took time to **observe** and understand the situation. That's what makes a good detective."

Chen smiled. "I just did my job," she said. "But I think we should discuss what to do with the **theater**. **It**'s a beautiful **facility**. **It** would be a shame to leave **it** abandoned."

The supervisor agreed. "I'll talk to the town council," he said. "Maybe we can **hire** someone to **operate** **it** again. The community could use a cultural center."

Over the next few months, Chen followed the case closely. The **European** **institute** researchers were fined but not imprisoned. They agreed to **operate** **fully** within legal frameworks in the future. They also apologized to the community for using the **theater** without permission.

The best outcome was that the town council decided to restore the **theater**. They **hire**d a new director and formed a committee to **operate** the **facility**. By **winter**, the **theater** was hosting its first performances in years.

Chen attended the opening night. She sat in the **front** row, surrounded by **lots** of excited community members. The **light**s dimmed, and the show began. She felt proud knowing that her investigation had led to this positive result.

The case of the **forest** **theater** became famous in Chen's career. **It** taught her that police work wasn't just about catching criminals. Sometimes **it** was about understanding why people made wrong choices and finding ways to **settle** **issue**s that benefited everyone.

Chen continued to work **daily**, **focus**ing on serving her community. She remained **aware** of the **background** of each case, always trying to see the bigger picture. She knew that good detective work required patience, careful **measure**ment of evidence, and the ability to **operate** with both firmness and understanding.

**The** **theater** **operate**s successfully to this day. Every **Tuesday**, **it** hosts special performances. The community has created a **poll** to decide what shows to present. Everything is done **fully** **above** board, in the **light** of **day**, with complete transparency.

Chen sometimes walks past the **theater** on her patrols. She smiles when she sees people entering for performances. The old **facility** has found new life. What started as a mystery in the **forest** has become a story of community renewal.

The lesson from this case is clear: sometimes the law is about more than just enforcement. **It**'s about finding solutions that serve justice while also helping communities thrive. Chen's **focus** on both aspects made her not just a good detective but a valuable member of her town.

## 📖 中文翻译 (Chinese Translation)

### 森林剧院之谜

八月一个寒冷的星期二早晨,陈警探来到了森林前的老剧院。这个设施已经关闭多年,但最近有很多奇怪的活动被报告。有人在使用这座废弃建筑,警察需要查明是谁。

陈慢慢穿过主入口,她的脚步声在木地板上回响。剧院又黑又满是灰尘。她可以看到前面的舞台,演员们曾经在那里为很多人表演。现在它空荡荡地矗立着,在褪色的幕布下面。

"我需要对一切保持警觉,"陈想。她被雇来调查从森林中多次看到的神秘灯光。当地居民很担心。有些人声称看到有人把在线设备搬进剧院。其他人说听到夜里有奇怪的音乐。

陈测量了从入口到舞台的距离——大约五十英尺。她走过旧剧院座位的上方,检查每一个细节。她在灰尘中发现了一双鞋印,通向后台区域。肯定最近有人来过这里。

"我应该专注于后台,"陈决定。她慢慢移动,小心不要破坏任何证据。走的时候,她思考着这个案子。剧院位于几代人前一个富裕家庭捐赠的欧洲土地上。它曾经是镇上文化生活的中心。

陈在舞台下面发现了一个小房间。里面,她发现了很多现代设备——电脑、照明装备,以及看起来像在线直播设备的东西。墙上还有一张关于公众舆论的民调图表。

"这很有趣,"陈嘟囔着。她用手机拍照,小心地安静操作。她不想惊动任何使用这个空间的人。这些设备看起来昂贵且专业。

陈穿过后台区域到另一边。她发现一张桌子,上面的文件显示了总统民调计划和调查区域的划分。还有一份来自研究公共舆论的机构的文件。似乎有人在进行秘密研究。

侦探的头脑飞速运转。这不仅仅是有人为了好玩使用废弃剧院。这是一个专业的操作。在采取行动之前,她需要了解全貌。她决定安顿下来等待有人到来。

陈在舞台上方找到了一个藏身之处,在那里她可以看到整个设施。她看了看手表——还是早上。她需要耐心。她专注于保持警惕和觉察。

时间慢慢过去。冬日的太阳在天空中移动,通过破窗户送进光线。陈保持静止,她的注意力集中在任务上。在执法多年中,她学会了耐心。有时你必须等待合适的时机。

三点钟,陈听到了脚步声。多人进入剧院。她慢慢地从上方观察,三个人穿过主楼层走向后台。他们带着很多设备。

陈仔细听着。这些人在讨论即将到来的总统选举的民调。他们试图在没有官方批准的情况下衡量公众舆论。他们雇用这个秘密设施来避免政府检测。

"我们需要更谨慎地操作,"一个人说。"有人可能会意识到我们在做什么。"

"别担心,"另一个人回答。"这个剧院很完美。没有人再来森林了。我们可以在这里专注于我们的工作。"

陈慢慢移动以获得更好的视野。她认出了其中一个人——来自当地研究所的研究员。她还看到在线直播设备正在设置。他们计划进行现场民调并在没有许可的情况下在线播放。

侦探知道她必须采取行动。这种未经授权的民调可能会影响总统选举。她需要妥善解决这种情况。她悄悄呼叫增援,对着无线电低声说话。

"守住出口,"她低语。"内部有多名嫌疑人。正在进行非法民调操作。"

几分钟内,其他警官到达了。他们缓慢而安静地移动,在每个出口定位自己。陈发出信号,他们一起行动。嫌疑人感到惊讶,没有时间逃跑。

"这个设施被非法使用,"陈宣布。"你们正在进行未经授权的民调活动。你们需要跟我们走。"

研究人员试图解释。他们说他们来自一个研究民主进程的欧洲机构。他们声称他们需要秘密操作以获得诚实的回应。他们认为官方民调受到政府压力的影响。

陈听了但保持坚定。"我理解你们的担忧,"她说。"但你们不能像这样秘密操作。有进行民调的适当渠道。你们需要通过合法手段照亮你们的活动,而不是躲在废弃的剧院里。"

嫌疑人被带到警察局。陈留下来记录一切。她测量了空间,拍摄了设备,并做了详细笔记。这个案子将提交给总统选举委员会。

当陈锁上剧院时,她以新的欣赏眼光看着这个老设施。它曾经给社区带来欢乐和文化。现在它成了非法操作的地点。她希望它能被恢复并再次正确使用。

穿过森林回去时,陈反思了这个案子。她感到满意,因为她解决了这件事。非法民调操作已被制止。总统选举将受到保护,免受未经授权的影响。

八月的星期二晚上通常很安静,但今晚陈有很多文书工作要完成。她开车回到局里,她的注意力仍然集中在细节上。她需要为委员会写一份综合报告。

在局里,陈的主管赞扬了她的工作。"你表现出了出色的警觉性,"他说。"你没有贸然行动。你花时间观察和理解情况。这才是一个好侦探。"

陈微笑着。"我只是做了我的工作,"她说。"但我认为我们应该讨论如何处理剧院。它是一个美丽的设施。让它废弃将是一种遗憾。"

主管同意了。"我会和镇议会谈谈,"他说。"也许我们可以雇人再次运营它。社区可以使用一个文化中心。"

在接下来的几个月里,陈密切关注这个案子。欧洲机构的研究人员被罚款但未被监禁。他们同意将来完全在法律框架内运作。他们还为未经许可使用剧院向社区道歉。

最好的结果是镇议会决定恢复剧院。他们雇用了一位新主任并组成了一个委员会来运营设施。到冬天,剧院正在举办多年来的第一场表演。

陈参加了开幕之夜。她坐在前排,周围是很多兴奋的社区成员。灯光变暗,表演开始了。她感到自豪,知道她的调查带来了这个积极的结果。

森林剧院案成为陈职业生涯中的著名案件。它教会她警察工作不仅仅是抓捕罪犯。有时是关于理解为什么人们做出错误的选择,并找到解决问题的方法,让每个人都受益。

陈继续每天工作,专注于为她的社区服务。她对每个案件的背景保持警觉,总是试图看到更大的图景。她知道好的侦探工作需要耐心、仔细测量证据,以及既坚定又理解的能力。

剧院至今仍成功运营。每个星期二,它都会举办特别表演。社区创建了一个民调来决定呈现什么节目。一切都完全公开地、在光天化日之下、完全透明地进行。

陈有时在巡逻时路过剧院。当她看到人们进入观看表演时,她微笑了。这个老设施找到了新生命。从森林中的神秘事件开始的事情已经成为社区更新的故事。

这个案子的教训很清楚:有时法律不仅仅是执法。它是关于找到既服务于正义又帮助社区繁荣的解决方案。陈对这两个方面的专注使她不仅是一名好侦探,而且是她镇上的宝贵成员。
