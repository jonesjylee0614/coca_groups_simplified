## 📖 Reading Passage: The **Good** **Carpet** Mystery

On the **continent** of Africa, there was a small village **nearby** a vast **ecosystem** of forests and grasslands. The village was home to fifty families who lived a simple life, raising **cattle** and growing **herbs**. Among them lived Marcus, a young **mechanic** who had recently completed his **full-time** studies and returned to help his community.

One morning, Marcus received **supposedly** urgent news. The village elder's **beloved** old **carpet**, made from fine **cloth** and passed down through generations, had been stolen by a **thief** during the night. This **carpet** was not just any **cloth** - it held great **dignity** for the village, as it was used in important ceremonies and was said to carry the wisdom of their **prophet**.

The elder asked Marcus to investigate **on** his **behalf**. Marcus agreed, though he felt **hurt** by the accusation that someone from their own village could do such a thing. He began his investigation by creating a **questionnaire** to gather information from the villagers. He wanted to understand the **departure** time of any strangers and whether anyone had seen anything unusual.

Marcus discovered through his **questionnaire** that a **diplomatic** visitor had come to the village three days before. This visitor, **allegedly**, had been interested in the **interior** decorations of the elder's house and had asked many questions about the **carpet**. The visitor had **supposedly** **left** the village the morning after the theft.

Marcus knew he couldn't just **contend** with rumors and **allegedly** facts. He needed solid evidence. He examined the scene carefully, looking for any **trace** of the **thief**. Near the window, he found a piece of **cloth** that didn't match the stolen **carpet**. It was a **sort** of modern fabric, not traditional **cloth**.

He also noticed **fossil**-like **footprints** in the dried mud outside - **supposedly** from someone **running** away quickly. Marcus created a **graph** to track the timeline of events, marking when people had seen the visitor and when the **carpet** was discovered missing.

The village council decided to send Marcus and two others on a **patrol** to find the **thief**. They would **spread** out and search the **nearby** towns. Before they **left**, Marcus checked his **pulse** - he was nervous but determined. This investigation could **attribute** peace or conflict to the village's future.

Marcus traveled to the **nearby** town where the **diplomatic** visitor had **supposedly** gone. There, he visited the market where merchants were **serving** customers. One vendor, seeing Marcus's serious face, asked what was wrong. Marcus explained about the stolen **carpet**, being careful not to **offend** anyone with accusations.

The vendor said that yes, a stranger had tried to sell an old **carpet** here two days ago, but when asked about its origin, the person had become nervous and **left** quickly. The vendor could **contend** that it was **allegedly** a very **good** **carpet**, worth a **minimum** of several thousand dollars on the **commercial** market.

Marcus asked if there was any **subsidy** program or reward system for recovering stolen goods. The vendor mentioned that the town had recently **cast** a vote to establish such a system through **electoral** **compromise**, but it was still in the **screening** process.

Following the lead, Marcus went to the **nearby** hotels, **continuing** his search. At the third hotel, the **mechanic** working there - fixing the **interior** **heating** system - recognized Marcus's description. The stranger had stayed there and had **left** a forwarding address **on** a piece of paper.

Marcus felt his **pulse** quicken with hope. He traveled **safely** to the address, which led to a small house **nearby** an **olive** grove. There, he found the **diplomatic** visitor sitting on the stolen **carpet**, looking troubled. The man seemed to be suffering from some **syndrome** of guilt.

When confronted, the man broke down. He explained that he had acted **solely** out of desperation. His family was struggling with high **mortality** rates due to lack of medical care, and he thought selling the **carpet** could help. He knew it was wrong, but he had made a terrible **compromise** with his conscience.

Marcus felt **hurt** for the man but knew the **carpet** had to be returned. He explained that stealing, no matter the reason, could not be justified. The village had its own struggles - they received **minimal** **subsidy** from the government and had to work **full-time** just to survive. Yet they maintained their **dignity** through honest work.

The man agreed to return the **carpet** and apologized deeply. Marcus, showing **good** character, suggested the man talk to the village elder about his family's situation. Perhaps there could be a **compromise** where the village could help through their **herb** medicines and shared resources rather than through theft.

They returned to the village together. The elder was moved by the **thief**'s honest **confession** and the **good** judgment Marcus had shown. The **sort** of **dignity** and wisdom Marcus displayed reminded everyone why their **prophet** had taught them about **compassion** and understanding.

The elder decided that instead of punishment, they would help the man's family. They would send **herbs** and teach them about their **ecosystem** - how to raise **cattle** and grow crops **safely**. They would **cast** a vote in the village council to establish a **continuing** exchange program.

The man was grateful and promised to work **on** **behalf** of both communities to establish better **diplomatic** relations. He would **contend** for peace and cooperation, not conflict. His **departure** from the village this time was marked by friendship, not suspicion.

Marcus learned valuable lessons from this experience. He completed his **homework** on human nature - understanding that people sometimes act out of desperation, not evil. The **graph** of this case showed not just a theft and recovery, but a story of **compassion** winning over conflict.

The **carpet** was cleaned and **restored** to its place in the elder's house. Its **cloth** patterns seemed to shine more brightly, as if the **carpet** itself was happy to be home. The **interior** of the elder's house felt complete again.

Marcus continued his work as a **mechanic**, but he was now also seen as a **good** **mediator** and problem solver. People would come to him not just to fix machines but to seek advice. He had shown that **supposedly** difficult problems could be solved through **understanding** and **compromise**, not force.

The village decided to create a **questionnaire** about what had happened, using it as a teaching tool. They wanted **continuing** generations to understand the importance of **dignity**, honest work, and helping others in need. The **screening** of new community members would include these values.

Years later, when Marcus looked back on this event, he realized it had been a turning point. The **patrol** to find the **thief** had taught him more than any **full-time** course could have. It taught him about the **minimum** standards of **justice** and the maximum power of **mercy**.

The **fossil** **footprints** in the mud had long since washed away, but the **footprints** of **kindness** remained in everyone's hearts. The two communities - Marcus's village and the man's town - established **continuing** cooperation, sharing **herbs**, **helping** with **cattle**, and protecting their shared **ecosystem**.

The **prophet**'s wisdom, woven into the threads of the **carpet**, had proven true: that **good** judgment combined with **compassion** could transform a **thief** into a friend, and a crime into an opportunity for **unity**. The **carpet** was more than just **cloth** - it was a symbol of **dignity**, **tradition**, and the **good** that exists in people when given a chance to make things right.

Marcus often **left** **olive** branches at the elder's door as a **tribute**, a symbol of the peace that had been achieved. He knew that his role **on** **behalf** of the village was not just to fix things but to fix relationships, to help people find **compromise** when they felt there was none.

The village's **full-time** farmers, **mechanics**, and families all took pride in how the situation had been handled. They had shown that even when **hurt** by betrayal, they could respond with **dignity**. They had proven that their **ecosystem** of values was **good** and worth protecting.

And **supposedly**, on quiet nights, if you **listened** carefully **nearby** the elder's house, you could hear the **carpet** **whispering** the **prophet**'s teachings to the wind - lessons about **dignity**, **compromise**, and the **continuing** journey toward being **good** to one another.

## 📖 中文翻译 (Chinese Translation)

### 好地毯之谜

在非洲大陆上,有一个小村庄位于森林和草原的广阔生态系统附近。村庄里住着五十户家庭,过着简单的生活,饲养牲畜和种植草药。其中住着马库斯,一位年轻的机械师,他刚完成全日制学业回来帮助社区。

一天早上,马库斯收到了据说是紧急的消息。村长老的珍贵旧地毯在夜间被小偷偷走了,这块地毯是用上等布料制成的,代代相传。这块地毯不仅仅是一块布——它对村庄有着极大的尊严意义,因为它被用于重要仪式,据说承载着他们先知的智慧。

长老请马库斯代表他进行调查。马库斯同意了,尽管他对有人指控他们自己村庄的人会做这种事感到受伤。他开始调查,制作了一份问卷来收集村民的信息。他想了解任何陌生人的离开时间,以及是否有人看到了什么不寻常的事情。

马库斯通过问卷发现,三天前有一位外交访客来到村庄。据称,这位访客对长老房子的室内装饰很感兴趣,问了很多关于地毯的问题。据说这位访客在盗窃发生后的早晨离开了村庄。

马库斯知道他不能只是与谣言和所谓的事实争论。他需要确凿的证据。他仔细检查现场,寻找小偷的任何痕迹。在窗户附近,他发现了一块与被盗地毯不匹配的布料。这是一种现代织物,不是传统布料。

他还注意到外面干泥中有类似化石的脚印——据说来自某个快速逃跑的人。马库斯创建了一个图表来追踪事件的时间线,标记人们何时看到访客以及何时发现地毯失踪。

村委会决定派马库斯和另外两人巡逻寻找小偷。他们会分散开来搜索附近的城镇。在他们离开之前,马库斯检查了自己的脉搏——他很紧张但很坚定。这次调查可能归因于村庄未来的和平或冲突。

马库斯前往那位外交访客据说去过的附近城镇。在那里,他参观了商人们正在服务顾客的市场。一位供应商看到马库斯严肃的表情,问出了什么事。马库斯解释了被盗地毯的事情,小心翼翼地不用指控冒犯任何人。

供应商说是的,两天前有个陌生人试图在这里卖一块旧地毯,但当被问及其来源时,那人变得紧张并迅速离开了。供应商可以断言,据称那是一块非常好的地毯,在商业市场上至少价值几千美元。

马库斯问是否有任何补贴计划或追回被盗物品的奖励制度。供应商提到,该镇最近通过选举妥协投票建立了这样的制度,但仍在筛选过程中。

根据线索,马库斯去了附近的旅馆,继续搜寻。在第三家旅馆,那里的机械师——正在修理室内供暖系统——认出了马库斯的描述。那个陌生人住在那里,并在一张纸上留下了转发地址。

马库斯感到自己的脉搏因希望而加快。他安全地前往那个地址,地址通往橄榄林附近的一所小房子。在那里,他发现那位外交访客坐在被盗的地毯上,看起来很烦恼。那人似乎患有某种内疚综合症。

当面对质时,那人崩溃了。他解释说,他的行为完全是出于绝望。他的家庭因缺乏医疗保健而面临高死亡率,他认为卖掉地毯可以帮忙。他知道这是错误的,但他与自己的良心做了可怕的妥协。

马库斯为这个人感到难过,但知道地毯必须归还。他解释说,无论什么原因,偷窃都不能被证明是正当的。村庄有自己的困难——他们从政府那里得到的补贴很少,必须全职工作才能生存。然而他们通过诚实的工作保持着尊严。

那人同意归还地毯并深深道歉。马库斯表现出良好的品格,建议那人与村长老谈谈他家庭的情况。也许可以达成妥协,村庄可以通过他们的草药和共享资源来帮助,而不是通过盗窃。

他们一起返回村庄。长老被小偷的诚实坦白和马库斯表现出的良好判断所感动。马库斯展现的那种尊严和智慧让每个人都想起了为什么他们的先知教导他们关于同情和理解。

长老决定不惩罚,而是帮助那人的家庭。他们会送草药,教他们关于生态系统的知识——如何安全地饲养牲畜和种植作物。他们将在村委会投票建立一个持续的交流项目。

那人很感激,并承诺代表两个社区工作,建立更好的外交关系。他将为和平与合作而奋斗,而不是冲突。他这次从村庄的离开标志着友谊,而不是怀疑。

马库斯从这次经历中学到了宝贵的教训。他完成了关于人性的功课——理解人们有时出于绝望而不是邪恶行事。这个案件的图表不仅显示了盗窃和追回,还展示了同情战胜冲突的故事。

地毯被清洗并恢复到长老房子里的位置。它的布料图案似乎更加明亮,好像地毯本身也很高兴回家。长老房子的室内再次感到完整。

马库斯继续他的机械师工作,但他现在也被视为一个好的调解人和问题解决者。人们来找他不仅是修理机器,还寻求建议。他展示了据说困难的问题可以通过理解和妥协来解决,而不是武力。

村庄决定创建一份关于所发生事情的问卷,将其作为教学工具。他们希望后续几代人理解尊严、诚实工作和帮助有需要的人的重要性。新社区成员的筛选将包括这些价值观。

多年后,当马库斯回顾这一事件时,他意识到这是一个转折点。寻找小偷的巡逻教会了他比任何全日制课程都多的东西。它教会了他关于正义的最低标准和仁慈的最大力量。

泥中的化石脚印早已被冲走,但善良的脚印留在了每个人的心中。两个社区——马库斯的村庄和那人的城镇——建立了持续的合作,分享草药,帮助照料牲畜,保护他们共同的生态系统。

编织在地毯线中的先知智慧被证明是真实的:良好的判断加上同情可以将小偷变成朋友,将犯罪变成团结的机会。地毯不仅仅是布料——它是尊严、传统和人们在有机会纠正错误时存在的善良的象征。

马库斯经常在长老门前留下橄榄枝作为贡品,象征着已经实现的和平。他知道他代表村庄的角色不仅是修理东西,而是修复关系,帮助人们在感觉没有妥协时找到妥协。

村庄的全职农民、机械师和家庭都为情况的处理方式感到自豪。他们展示了即使被背叛伤害,也能以尊严回应。他们证明了他们的价值观生态系统是好的,值得保护。

据说,在安静的夜晚,如果你在长老房子附近仔细聆听,你可以听到地毯向风低语先知的教诲——关于尊严、妥协和彼此善待的持续旅程的教训。
