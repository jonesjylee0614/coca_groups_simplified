## 📖 Reading Passage: The Environmental Dream

It was a **dark** night in the **central** **region** of the city when Sarah first had her **dream**. She had been working as an **employee** at a local company for **eight** years, but she knew that her **purpose** was to help protect the **environment**.

**Since** she was a child, she had always been concerned about the **environment**. She had seen the **impact** of pollution on her community, and she wanted to do something to help.

The next morning, she woke up with a clear **strategy**. She would **set** up a **committee** to address environmental issues in her **region**. She knew that this would be a huge challenge, but she was determined to make it happen.

Her first step was to **lay** out her plan. She needed to find a **method** to raise funds for the project. She also needed to get the support of local authorities and the **union** of community members.

One day, she decided to **interview** a **professor** from the nearby university. The **professor** was an expert on environmental science, and she hoped that he could help her develop a better **strategy**.

"I think your idea is **perfect**," the **professor** said during the **interview**. "But you need to **clearly** define your goals. What is the **main** **purpose** of your **committee**?"

Sarah thought for a moment. "I want to **remove** pollution from our community," she said. "I want to create a **safe** **environment** for everyone to live in."

"That is a good start," the **professor** said. "But you also need to consider how you will **fund** this project. Environmental work requires resources, and you need to have a plan for how to get those resources."

Sarah nodded. She knew that this was an important point. She had not yet figured out how to **fund** her project, but she was determined to find a way.

After the **interview**, she went home and began to work on her **strategy**. She wrote down her **main** goals and the methods she would use to achieve them. She also listed the options she had for funding.

One **option** was to apply for a grant from the government. Another **option** was to raise money from the community. A third **option** was to work with local businesses to get their support.

She decided to try all three options. She knew that this would be a lot of work, but she was committed to her **dream**.

The next week, she **set** up a meeting with the local **authority**. She presented her plan and explained how it would benefit the community. The **authority** was interested, but they wanted to see more details.

"We need to see a complete proposal," they said. "We also need to know how you plan to measure the **impact** of your work."

Sarah agreed. She knew that she needed to provide more information. She went back to work on her proposal, spending **ten** hours a day on it.

As she worked, she began to realize that she needed **training** in how to write a professional proposal. She decided to take a course at the local community college.

The **training** was helpful, and she learned a lot about how to structure a proposal. She also learned about how to **account** for different types of funding and how to **indicate** the **impact** of her work.

After completing the **training**, she went back to work on her proposal. She spent another week refining it, making sure that every detail was **perfect**.

Finally, she was ready to submit her proposal. She sent it to the local **authority**, and then she waited for their response.

A few weeks later, she received a call from the **authority**. They wanted to meet with her again to discuss her proposal.

"We are impressed by your work," they said. "We think that your **strategy** is sound, and we are willing to provide some funding for your project."

Sarah was thrilled. She had not expected to get funding so quickly, but she was grateful for the support.

The **authority** provided her with enough funds to get started, but they also told her that she would need to raise more money from other sources if she wanted to complete her project.

Sarah agreed. She knew that this was just the beginning, and she was ready to work hard to achieve her goals.

The next step was to **set** up the **committee**. She invited people from all over the **region** to join. She wanted to make sure that everyone had a voice in the process.

The first meeting of the **committee** was held on a bright sunny day. The **sun** was shining brightly **outside**, and the room was filled with people who were excited about the project.

Sarah stood on the **stage** and addressed the **committee**. "I want to thank you all for coming," she said. "We are here today to discuss how we can work together to protect our **environment**."

She explained her **strategy** **clearly**, and she answered questions from the **committee** members. Everyone seemed to be on board with the plan, and they were excited to get started.

"I think this is a **perfect** opportunity for us to make a difference," one **committee** member said. "We have been talking about environmental issues for years, but now we finally have a plan to do something about it."

Sarah was pleased to hear this. She knew that she needed the support of the community, and she was glad that people were willing to help.

After the meeting, she went home feeling optimistic. She knew that there was still a lot of work to do, but she was confident that she could achieve her goals.

The next few months were busy. Sarah and her **committee** worked hard to implement their **strategy**. They organized cleanup events, planted trees, and educated the community about environmental issues.

One day, she received a call from a local **artist**. The **artist** wanted to create a mural to raise awareness about environmental issues. She thought that this was a great idea, and she agreed to work with the **artist**.

The **artist** created a beautiful mural on the wall of a building in the **central** **region**. The mural depicted a bright **blue** sky and a green landscape, reminding people of the beauty of nature.

"This is exactly what we need," Sarah thought as she looked at the mural. "We need to remind people of the beauty of the **environment** so that they will want to protect it."

As the months passed, Sarah began to see the **impact** of her work. The community was becoming more aware of environmental issues, and people were starting to take action.

Sarah was grateful for the donation. She knew that she needed more funds to complete her project, and this donation would help her achieve her goals.

The business owner also offered to help her organize fundraising events. He said that he had experience in organizing events, and he was willing to share his knowledge.

Sarah agreed. She knew that she could learn a lot from him, and she was excited to work with him.

Together, they organized a series of fundraising events. The events were successful, and they raised enough money to **fund** the next phase of the project.

One of the events was held on a **stage** in the **central** park. People from all over the **region** came to attend. There was music, food, and activities for children.

Sarah stood on the **stage** and spoke to the crowd. "I want to thank you all for coming," she said. "Your support means everything to us. Together, we can make a difference."

The crowd cheered, and Sarah felt proud of what she had accomplished. She knew that she had come a long way **since** she first had her **dream**, and she was excited about what the future would bring.

As the project continued, Sarah began to face new challenges. There was **pressure** from some people who did not support her work. They thought that she was wasting money on something that would not make a difference.

Sarah knew that she needed to **avoid** getting discouraged. She reminded **herself** of her **purpose**, and she focused on the positive **impact** that her work was having.

She also knew that she needed to **account** for all the money she was spending. She kept detailed records of all her expenses, and she made sure that every dollar was being used effectively.

One day, she received a call from a local newspaper. They wanted to write a story about her project. She agreed to be interviewed, and she explained her **strategy** and the **impact** that her work was having.

The article was published the next week, and it generated a lot of positive attention. More people began to support her project, and she received more donations.

Sarah was pleased with the response. She knew that publicity was important for her project, and she was glad that people were becoming more aware of her work.

As the project continued, Sarah began to see more results. The air quality in the **region** was improving, and people were starting to take better care of their **environment**.

One day, she received a call from the **professor** she had interviewed earlier. He wanted to congratulate her on her success.

"I am so proud of what you have accomplished," he said. "You have proven that one person can make a difference. Your work has had a significant **impact** on the community."

Sarah was touched by his words. She knew that she had worked hard, but she also knew that she could not have done it without the support of others.

"Thank you," she said. "Your advice was invaluable, and I am grateful for your support."

The **professor** smiled. "You are welcome," he said. "I am glad that I could help. Keep up the good work."

As the years passed, Sarah's project continued to grow. She expanded her work to other regions, and she became known as a leader in environmental protection.

One day, she was invited to speak at a national conference on environmental issues. She was nervous about speaking in front of such a large audience, but she knew that this was an opportunity to share her story with others.

She prepared her speech carefully, and she practiced it many times. When the day arrived, she stood on the **stage** and spoke to the audience.

"I want to tell you about my **dream**," she said. "I dreamed of a world where people would take care of the **environment**, where we would work together to protect our planet."

She explained her **strategy**, and she shared the **impact** that her work had had. The audience was inspired by her story, and they gave her a standing ovation.

After the conference, Sarah received many emails from people who wanted to start similar projects in their own communities. She was happy to help them, and she provided them with advice and resources.

Sarah knew that her work was making a difference, and she was proud of what she had accomplished. She had started with a **dream**, and she had turned it into a reality.

### 环境保护的梦想

那是一个黑暗的夜晚，在城市的中心地区，Sarah第一次有了她的梦想。她在一家当地公司做员工已经八年了，但她知道她的目的是帮助保护环境。

自从她还是个孩子的时候，她就一直关心环境。她看到了污染对她社区的影响，她想做些什么来帮助。

第二天早上，她带着一个清晰的策略醒来。她将建立一个委员会来应对她所在地区的环境问题。她知道这将是一个巨大的挑战，但她决心要实现它。

她的第一步是制定她的计划。她需要找到一个方法来为项目筹集资金。她还需要获得当地当局和社区成员联盟的支持。

一天，她决定采访附近大学的一位教授。这位教授是环境科学方面的专家，她希望他能帮助她制定一个更好的策略。

"我认为你的想法很完美，"教授在采访中说。"但你需要清楚地定义你的目标。你委员会的主要目的是什么？"

Sarah想了一会儿。"我想从我们的社区移除污染，"她说。"我想为每个人创造一个安全的生活环境。"

"这是一个好的开始，"教授说。"但你也需要考虑如何为这个项目提供资金。环境保护工作需要资源，你需要有一个计划来获得这些资源。"

Sarah点了点头。她知道这是一个重要的观点。她还没有想出如何为她的项目提供资金，但她决心找到方法。

采访结束后，她回到家，开始制定她的策略。她写下了她的主要目标和实现这些目标的方法。她还列出了她可以选择的资金选项。

一个选择是向政府申请资助。另一个选择是从社区筹集资金。第三个选择是与当地企业合作以获得他们的支持。

她决定尝试所有三个选项。她知道这将需要很多工作，但她致力于她的梦想。

下一周，她与当地当局安排了一次会议。她介绍了她的计划，并解释了它将如何使社区受益。当局很感兴趣，但他们想看到更多的细节。

"我们需要看到一个完整的提案，"他们说。"我们还需要知道你计划如何衡量你工作的影响。"

Sarah同意了。她知道她需要提供更多信息。她回去继续完善她的提案，每天花十个小时在上面。

当她工作时，她开始意识到她需要接受如何撰写专业提案的培训。她决定在当地社区学院修一门课程。

培训很有帮助，她学到了很多关于如何构建提案的知识。她还学到了如何为不同类型的资金做账，以及如何表明她工作的影响。

完成培训后，她回去继续完善她的提案。她又花了一周时间完善它，确保每个细节都完美。

最后，她准备好提交她的提案了。她把它发送给当地当局，然后她等待他们的回应。

几周后，她接到了当局的电话。他们想再次与她见面讨论她的提案。

"我们对你的工作印象深刻，"他们说。"我们认为你的策略是合理的，我们愿意为你的项目提供一些资金。"

Sarah非常兴奋。她没想到这么快就能获得资金，但她对支持表示感谢。

当局为她提供了足够的资金来开始，但他们也告诉她，如果她想完成她的项目，她将需要从其他来源筹集更多资金。

Sarah同意了。她知道这只是开始，她准备好努力工作来实现她的目标。

下一步是建立委员会。她邀请来自整个地区的人们加入。她想确保每个人在这个过程中都有发言权。

委员会的第一次会议在一个阳光明媚的日子举行。外面的阳光明媚，房间里挤满了对这个项目感到兴奋的人们。

Sarah站在舞台上，向委员会致辞。"我想感谢你们所有人来到这里，"她说。"我们今天在这里讨论如何共同努力保护我们的环境。"

她清楚地解释了她的策略，并回答了委员会成员的问题。每个人似乎都同意这个计划，他们兴奋地想要开始。

"我认为这是我们有所作为的完美机会，"一位委员会成员说。"我们多年来一直在谈论环境问题，但现在我们终于有了一个计划来做些什么。"

Sarah很高兴听到这个消息。她知道她需要社区的支持，她很感激人们愿意帮助。

会议结束后，她回到家，感到乐观。她知道还有很多工作要做，但她有信心能够实现她的目标。

接下来的几个月很忙碌。Sarah和她的委员会努力工作以实施他们的策略。他们组织了清理活动，种植树木，并教育社区了解环境问题。

一天，她接到了一位当地艺术家的电话。这位艺术家想创作一幅壁画来提高人们对环境问题的认识。她认为这是一个好主意，她同意与艺术家合作。

艺术家在中心地区一栋建筑的墙上创作了一幅美丽的壁画。壁画描绘了明亮的蓝天和绿色的景观，提醒人们大自然的美丽。

"这正是我们需要的，"Sarah看着壁画时想。"我们需要提醒人们环境的美丽，这样他们就会想要保护它。"

随着几个月的过去，Sarah开始看到她工作的影响。社区对环境问题变得更加了解，人们开始采取行动。

一天，她接到了一位当地企业主的电话。这位企业主想向她的项目捐款。他说他看到了她工作的影响，他想支持它。

Sarah对捐款表示感谢。她知道她需要更多资金来完成她的项目，这笔捐款将帮助她实现她的目标。

企业主还提出帮助她组织筹款活动。他说他有组织活动的经验，他愿意分享他的知识。

Sarah同意了。她知道她可以从他身上学到很多东西，她很兴奋能与他合作。

他们一起组织了一系列筹款活动。这些活动很成功，他们筹集了足够的资金来资助项目的下一阶段。

其中一个活动在中心公园的舞台上举行。来自整个地区的人们前来参加。有音乐、食物和儿童活动。

Sarah站在舞台上，向人群讲话。"我想感谢你们所有人来到这里，"她说。"你们的支持对我们来说意味着一切。共同努力，我们可以有所作为。"

人群欢呼，Sarah为她所取得的成就感到骄傲。她知道自从她第一次有梦想以来，她已经走了很长的路，她对未来将带来的东西感到兴奋。

随着项目的继续，Sarah开始面临新的挑战。一些不支持她工作的人给她施加了压力。他们认为她正在把钱浪费在不会产生任何影响的事情上。

Sarah知道她需要避免感到沮丧。她提醒自己她的目的，她专注于她工作正在产生的积极影响。

她还知道她需要对她花费的所有资金进行核算。她保留了所有支出的详细记录，她确保每一美元都被有效使用。

一天，她接到了当地一家报纸的电话。他们想写一篇关于她项目的文章。她同意接受采访，她解释了她的策略和她工作正在产生的影响。

文章在下一周发表，它产生了许多积极的关注。更多的人开始支持她的项目，她收到了更多捐款。

Sarah对回应感到满意。她知道宣传对她的项目很重要，她很感激人们开始更多地了解她的工作。

随着项目的继续，Sarah开始看到更多结果。该地区的空气质量正在改善，人们开始更好地照顾他们的环境。

一天，她接到了她之前采访过的教授的电话。他想祝贺她的成功。

"我为你所取得的成就感到骄傲，"他说。"你已经证明了一个人可以有所作为。你的工作对社区产生了重大影响。"

Sarah被他的话感动了。她知道她工作很努力，但她也知道如果没有其他人的支持，她无法做到这一点。

"谢谢你，"她说。"你的建议是无价的，我很感激你的支持。"

教授笑了。"不客气，"他说。"我很高兴我能提供帮助。继续努力。"

随着岁月的流逝，Sarah的项目继续增长。她将工作扩展到其他地区，她成为环境保护领域的领导者。

一天，她被邀请在全国环境问题会议上发言。她对在如此大的观众面前发言感到紧张，但她知道这是一个与他人分享她的故事的机会。

她仔细准备她的演讲，她练习了很多次。当那天到来时，她站在舞台上，向观众讲话。

"我想告诉你们我的梦想，"她说。"我梦想着一个人们会照顾环境的世界，我们会共同努力保护我们的星球。"

她解释了她的策略，并分享了她工作的影响。观众被她的故事所鼓舞，他们给了她起立鼓掌。

会议结束后，Sarah收到了许多来自想要在自己社区开始类似项目的人的电子邮件。她很乐意帮助他们，她为他们提供了建议和资源。

Sarah知道她的工作正在产生影响，她为她所取得的成就感到骄傲。她从梦想开始，她已经把它变成了现实。

当她回顾她的旅程时，她意识到她学到了很多。她学到了拥有清晰策略的重要性，与他人合作的价值，以及坚持的力量。

她还学到了，如果你愿意努力工作，永不放弃，梦想就会成真。她已经证明了一个人可以有所作为，她对未来将带来的东西感到兴奋。

当她走过公园时，外面的阳光明媚。她看到孩子们在玩耍，她看到人们享受着美丽的环境。她知道她的工作帮助创造了这个美丽的场景，她为她所取得的成就感到骄傲。

她从梦想开始，她已经把它变成了现实。她知道还有工作要做，但她有信心能够继续有所作为。

未来是光明的，她兴奋地看到接下来会发生什么。
