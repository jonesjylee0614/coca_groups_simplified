## 📖 Reading Passage: The Power of Yet

Emma **wasn't** **good** at **drawing**. At least, that's what she **thought**. Every time she **tried**, her **pictures** **didn't** **look** **like** what she **imagined**. "I **can't** **draw**," she would **say**.

Her **art** **teacher**, Mr. Chen, **heard** this one day. "You **can't** **draw** **yet**," he **corrected** gently. "**Yet** is a **powerful** **word**. It **means** you're **still** **learning**."

Emma **hadn't** **thought** **about** it that **way**. "**Yet**?" she **repeated**.

"Yes," Mr. Chen **said**. "You **can't** **draw** **yet**. But **with** **practice**, you **will**. **Doesn't** that **sound** **better** than saying you **can't** **ever** **draw**?"

It **did** **sound** **better**. Emma **decided** to **try** **again**, this time **with** a **different** **mindset**. Instead of "I **can't**," she **started** saying "I **can't** **yet**."

She **wasn't** **great** at **shading** – **yet**. She **didn't** **understand** **perspective** – **yet**. Her **proportions** **weren't** **perfect** – **yet**. But the **word** **yet** **gave** her **hope**. It **said** that **improvement** was **possible**, that **learning** **hadn't** **ended**, that she **wasn't** **stuck** **where** she was.

**Months** **passed**. Emma **kept** **practicing**. **Slowly**, her **drawings** **improved**. They **weren**'**t** **perfect**, but they were **better** than **before**. And **more** **importantly**, she **didn't** **feel** **defeated** **anymore**. She **wasn**'**t** **good** **enough** – **yet**. But she was **getting** **there**.

"**Doesn**'t this **feel** **better**?" Mr. Chen **asked** one day, **looking** at her **latest** **work**.

"It **does**," Emma **smiled**. "I'm **not** **great** **yet**, but I'm **improving**. And that **feels** **good**."

Mr. Chen **nodded**. "That's the **power** of **yet**. It **transforms** 'I **can't**' **into** 'I **can't** **yet**.' One is a **dead** **end**. The **other** is a **journey**."

Emma **realized** this **wasn't** just about **drawing**. The **word** **yet** could **change** **how** she **approached** **everything**. She **wasn't** **confident** in **public** **speaking** – **yet**. She **hadn't** **mastered** **mathematics** – **yet**. She **didn't** **know** **what** **career** **to** **pursue** – **yet**.

"**Yet**," she **thought**, "is the **difference** **between** **giving** up and **keeping** **going**."

Years **later**, Emma became an **art** **teacher** **herself**. And when she **heard** **students** say "I **can't** **draw**," she would **always** **reply**: "You **can't** **draw** **yet**. But **doesn't** that **mean** you **will** **someday**?"
