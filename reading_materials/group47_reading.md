## 📖 Reading Passage: The Path to Recovery

**Dr.** Lisa **Chen** stood **outside** the **therapy** center, watching the **dark** **sky** gradually **brighten** as dawn approached. **Twenty** years of working with patients struggling with **alcohol** addiction and mental health issues had taught her that **recovery** was not just about **stopping** harmful behaviors—it was about building a **completely** **new** life.

"**Well**," she thought, checking her notes for the day's **first** session, "today marks an **achievement**. Michael has been **sober** for six months."

Michael **Roberts** sat **nervously** in the waiting **room**. His **childhood** had been marked by **violence** and **instability**. His father had a **violent** **personality**, and Michael had witnessed terrible things that **scared** him deeply. He had **turned** to **alcohol** to **numb** the pain, creating a **deficit** of emotional **well**-being that had lasted decades.

"**Good** morning, Michael," **Dr.** **Chen** greeted him warmly. "How are you feeling?"

"**Scared**, honestly," Michael admitted. "I'm **afraid** that I'll fail. That I won't be **capable** of maintaining this **sobriety**."

"That's a **reasonable** fear," **Dr.** **Chen** replied in a calm **tone**. "But let's **analyze** what you've **accomplished**. Six months ago, you couldn't imagine going **twenty** days without **drinking**. Now you've **stretched** that to **twenty** weeks. That's a significant **achievement**."

Michael nodded, but his expression remained **uncertain**. "I still have **symptoms** of **depression**. Sometimes I **dig** deep for **strength**, but it feels like I'm in a **dark** **hole** with no way **out**."

"**Recovery** is not **linear**," **Dr.** **Chen** explained. "It's more like **golf**—sometimes you make great **progress**, and sometimes you face **obstacles**. The key is to **keep** **playing**, to never **give** **up**."

Michael smiled **slightly** at the **analogy**. He had **loved** **golf** as a young man, **before** the **alcohol** took over his life. "My **favorite** **memory** from **childhood** was playing **golf** with my uncle. He was the only **supporter** I had. He never judged me, never made me feel **lower** than him."

"Tell me about your **transition** from childhood to adulthood," **Dr.** **Chen** suggested. "When did the **alcohol** use **begin**?"

Michael **took** a deep breath. "I was **twenty** when it started. I had just started college, **first** time away from home. The **freedom** was overwhelming. I didn't know how to **handle** it. I started drinking at parties, then drinking **alone**, then drinking to **function**."

"What was your **lowest** point?" **Dr.** **Chen** asked gently.

Michael's eyes filled with tears. "Two years ago. I was **drunk**, driving, and almost **killed** someone. A pregnant woman. **Fortunately**, I **stopped** the car just in time. But that **near-miss** **scared** me into reality. I realized I was becoming the **violent**, destructive person I had **feared** as a child—the very thing I hated about my father."

"That **realization** was your **turning** **point**," **Dr.** **Chen** noted. "The moment when you became **unable** to **pretend** anymore. Many people in **therapy** reach this **point** where they must **choose**: continue the **destructive** **path** or **acquire** new **coping** **mechanisms**."

"I chose **therapy**," Michael said. "But it's been **hard**. Really **hard**. Some days I feel **incapable** of continuing."

"Let's **analyze** your **progress**," **Dr.** **Chen** suggested, pulling out a **chart**. "When you **first** came here, you had **daily** **suicidal** thoughts. Now?"

"Maybe once a week," Michael admitted. "And they're **less** **intense**."

"That's **progress**," **Dr.** **Chen** said firmly. "You've **reduced** your **symptoms** by **eighty** **percent**. That's not **failure**—that's an **incredible** **achievement**."

They continued **discussing** Michael's **journey**. He had joined an **alcohol** **support** **group**, where he found other **supporters** who **understood** his **struggle**. He had started **therapy** **sessions** **twice** a week. He had **cut** contact with friends who still drank **heavily**. He had **acquired** new **hobbies**—**running**, **reading** **philosophy** books, and yes, playing **golf** again.

"My **complaint** is that **recovery** takes so **long**," Michael said. "I want to be **well** **immediately**."

"**Recovery** is a **marathon**, not a **sprint**," **Dr.** **Chen** replied. "Think of it like training for a **championship**. Athletes don't become champions **overnight**. They **train**, **fail**, **learn**, and **improve** over **years**. Your **mental** and **emotional** **health** requires the same **commitment**."

Michael looked **thoughtful**. "I never thought of it that way. I've been so **focused** on the **deficit**—what I've **lost**, what I've **damaged**—that I haven't **celebrated** the **positive** changes."

"**Exactly**," **Dr.** **Chen** said. "Let's **shift** your **focus**. What **achievements** are you **proud** of?"

Michael considered this. "**Well**, I **reconciled** with my **sister**. She had **stopped** **talking** to me because of my **drinking**. But last month, we had **lunch** together. She said she was **proud** of me. That meant **everything**."

"That's **beautiful**," **Dr.** **Chen** said warmly. "What else?"

"I got a **job**," Michael continued, his **tone** brightening. "Nothing **fancy**—I work at a **bookstore**. But it's **honest** work, and it makes me feel **capable** and **productive**. My **boss** is **supportive**. She knows about my **history** and gives me **flexibility** when I need **extra** **therapy** appointments."

"These are **substantial** **achievements**," **Dr.** **Chen** emphasized. "You're **rebuilding** your life, **relationship** by **relationship**, **day** by **day**. That requires **tremendous** **courage**."

As the **session** continued, they **discussed** **strategies** for managing **difficult** moments. **Dr.** **Chen** taught Michael **breathing** **techniques** to use when **anxiety** **rose**. They **practiced** **cognitive** **reframing**—**changing** **negative** **thoughts** into more **balanced** **ones**.

"When you feel **scared** or **incapable**, **what** do you typically think?" **Dr.** **Chen** asked.

"I think, 'I'm going to **fail**. I'm **incapable** of being **sober**. I'm **unable** to **change**,'" Michael replied.

"Now let's **stretch** that thought," **Dr.** **Chen** suggested. "**Add** evidence to **balance** it. What would a more **accurate** thought be?"

Michael thought carefully. "**Well**... I've been **sober** for six months, which proves I'm **capable** of **change**. I have **supporters**—you, my **sister**, my **support** **group**. I've **acquired** new **skills** for **coping**. So maybe a more **accurate** thought is: '**Recovery** is **challenging**, but I have the **tools** and **support** to **succeed**.'"

"**Excellent**," **Dr.** **Chen** said. "That's a **much** more **balanced** **perspective**. **Philosophy** teaches us that our thoughts **shape** our **reality**. If you **think** you're **incapable**, you'll act **accordingly**. But if you **recognize** your **capability** and **achievements**, you'll **continue** **progressing**."

They also **discussed** the importance of **addressing** **underlying** **trauma**. Michael's **violent** **childhood** had created **deep** **wounds** that **alcohol** had **temporarily** **masked**. True **recovery** required **processing** these **experiences**.

"It's like **surgery** on the **soul**," **Dr.** **Chen** explained. "**Painful** but **necessary**. You can't just **pretend** the **trauma** didn't **happen**. You must **face** it, **understand** it, and **gradually** **reduce** its **power** over you."

Michael wiped tears from his eyes. "Some days it feels **impossible**. The **pain** is so **deep**."

"I know," **Dr.** **Chen** said softly. "But you're **not** **alone**. We're **digging** through this together. And on the **other** **side** of this **pain** is **freedom**—**freedom** from **addiction**, from **trauma**, from the **patterns** that have **controlled** your life."

**Soon** the **session** came to an end. As Michael **prepared** to **leave**, **Dr.** **Chen** gave him an **assignment**: write down **three** **achievements** each day, no matter how **small**.

"Even if it's just 'I got out of bed' or 'I didn't drink today,'" she explained. "**Recognition** of **progress** is **essential** for maintaining **motivation**."

Over the following months, Michael continued his **therapy**. The **path** was not **straight**. He had **setbacks**—moments of **intense** **craving**, days of **deep** **depression**. But he **didn't** **relapse** into **drinking**. He used his **coping** **tools**, reached out to his **supporters**, and **pushed** through.

**Surely** but **gradually**, things **improved**. His **relationship** with his **sister** **deepened**. He was **promoted** at the **bookstore**. He started **dating** someone he met at his **support** **group**—a woman named **Sarah** who was also in **recovery** and **understood** his **journey**.

One year **after** starting **therapy**, Michael stood **outside** **Dr.** **Chen**'s office, looking at the same **dark**-**to**-**light** **sky** **transition** she had watched so many times. But this time, he **felt** **different**. **Lighter**. More **capable**. More **hopeful**.

"**Well**," he thought with a **smile**, "I'm **still** here. That's an **achievement** in itself."

His **therapy** session that day focused on **celebrating** his **progress** and **planning** for the **future**. **Dr.** **Chen** was **visibly** **proud**.

"Michael, you've made **remarkable** **progress**," she said. "From someone who felt **incapable** and **scared**, you've **transformed** into someone who is **capable**, **resilient**, and **hopeful**. That's not **luck**—that's **hard** **work** and **commitment**."

"Thank you for never **giving** **up** on me," Michael said, his voice **emotional**. "There were times I was **sober** **outside** but **violent** and **dark** **inside**. You helped me **dig** my way **out**."

"You did the **digging**," **Dr.** **Chen** corrected gently. "I just provided the **tools** and held the **light**."

As Michael **left** the **therapy** center, he **pulled** out his phone and texted **Sarah**: "Just finished **therapy**. One year **sober** today. Want to celebrate with **golf** and **dinner**?"

Her reply came quickly: "**Absolutely**! So **proud** of you. You're my **favorite** person."

Michael smiled. The **dark** days weren't completely behind him—**recovery** was an **ongoing** **process**, and he knew challenges would **still** come. But he had **acquired** the **skills**, **built** the **support** system, and **developed** the **personality** **strength** to **face** whatever came.

The **path** to **recovery** was **long** and **difficult**, but it was also **beautiful**. And Michael was **finally** **walking** it with **confidence**, **capability**, and **hope**.

### 康复之路

陈博士站在治疗中心外,看着黑暗的天空随着黎明的到来逐渐变亮。二十年来与酒精成瘾和心理健康问题患者一起工作教会了她,康复不仅仅是停止有害行为——而是建立一个全新的生活。

"好吧,"她想,查看当天第一次疗程的笔记,"今天标志着一个成就。迈克尔已经戒酒六个月了。"

迈克尔·罗伯茨紧张地坐在候诊室。他的童年充满了暴力和不稳定。他的父亲性格暴力,迈克尔目睹了让他深感恐惧的可怕事情。他转向酒精来麻痹痛苦,造成了持续数十年的情感幸福感缺失。

"早上好,迈克尔,"陈博士热情地问候他。"你感觉怎么样?"

"说实话,很害怕,"迈克尔承认。"我担心我会失败。我可能无法保持这种清醒状态。"

"这是一个合理的恐惧,"陈博士用平静的语气回答。"但让我们分析一下你完成了什么。六个月前,你无法想象二十天不喝酒。现在你已经延伸到二十周。这是一个重大成就。"

迈克尔点了点头,但他的表情仍然不确定。"我仍然有抑郁症状。有时我深挖力量,但感觉我在一个黑暗的洞里,无路可出。"

"康复不是线性的,"陈博士解释说。"它更像高尔夫——有时你取得巨大进步,有时你面临障碍。关键是继续打球,永不放弃。"

迈克尔对这个类比微微一笑。他年轻时喜欢高尔夫,在酒精接管他的生活之前。"我童年最喜欢的记忆是和叔叔打高尔夫。他是我唯一的支持者。他从不评判我,从不让我感到比他低等。"

"告诉我你从童年到成年的过渡,"陈博士建议。"酒精使用是什么时候开始的?"

迈克尔深吸一口气。"我二十岁时开始的。我刚开始上大学,第一次离家。自由让我不知所措。我不知道如何处理。我开始在派对上喝酒,然后独自喝酒,然后为了运作而喝酒。"

"你的最低点是什么时候?"陈博士温柔地问。

迈克尔的眼睛充满泪水。"两年前。我喝醉了,开车,差点杀死某人。一个孕妇。幸运的是,我及时停了车。但那次惊险让我回到现实。我意识到我正在成为我小时候害怕的那种暴力、破坏性的人——我憎恨父亲的那种人。"

"那个认识是你的转折点,"陈博士指出。"那一刻你再也无法假装。许多接受治疗的人都会到达这个必须选择的点:继续破坏性道路还是获得新的应对机制。"

"我选择了治疗,"迈克尔说。"但这很困难。真的很困难。有些日子我感到无法继续。"

"让我们分析你的进步,"陈博士建议,拿出一张图表。"当你第一次来这里时,你每天都有自杀念头。现在呢?"

"也许一周一次,"迈克尔承认。"而且强度降低了。"

"这就是进步,"陈博士坚定地说。"你已经将症状减少了百分之八十。这不是失败——这是一个令人难以置信的成就。"

他们继续讨论迈克尔的旅程。他加入了一个酒精支持小组,在那里他找到了其他理解他挣扎的支持者。他开始每周两次治疗。他切断了与仍然大量饮酒的朋友的联系。他获得了新的爱好——跑步、阅读哲学书籍,是的,再次打高尔夫。

"我的抱怨是康复需要这么长时间,"迈克尔说。"我想立即康复。"

"康复是马拉松,不是短跑,"陈博士回答。"把它想象成为锦标赛训练。运动员不是一夜之间成为冠军的。他们训练、失败、学习并在多年中不断提高。你的心理和情感健康需要同样的承诺。"

迈克尔看起来若有所思。"我从没这样想过。我一直专注于缺陷——我失去了什么,我破坏了什么——以至于我没有庆祝积极的变化。"

"正是如此,"陈博士说。"让我们转移你的焦点。你为哪些成就感到骄傲?"

迈克尔考虑了这个问题。"好吧,我与妹妹和解了。她因为我喝酒而停止和我说话。但上个月,我们一起吃了午饭。她说她为我感到骄傲。那意味着一切。"

"这太美好了,"陈博士温暖地说。"还有什么?"

"我找到了一份工作,"迈克尔继续说,语气变得明亮。"没什么花哨的——我在书店工作。但这是诚实的工作,让我感到有能力和有成效。我的老板很支持。她知道我的历史,在我需要额外治疗预约时给我灵活性。"

"这些都是重大成就,"陈博士强调。"你正在重建你的生活,一段关系一段关系,一天一天。这需要巨大的勇气。"

随着疗程的继续,他们讨论了管理困难时刻的策略。陈博士教迈克尔在焦虑上升时使用的呼吸技巧。他们练习认知重构——将负面想法转变为更平衡的想法。

"当你感到害怕或无能时,你通常会想什么?"陈博士问。

"我想,'我会失败。我无法保持清醒。我无法改变,'"迈克尔回答。

"现在让我们延伸那个想法,"陈博士建议。"添加证据来平衡它。更准确的想法会是什么?"

迈克尔仔细思考。"好吧...我已经戒酒六个月了,这证明我有能力改变。我有支持者——你、我妹妹、我的支持小组。我已经获得了新的应对技能。所以也许更准确的想法是:'康复是有挑战性的,但我有工具和支持来成功。'"

"太好了,"陈博士说。"这是一个更平衡的观点。哲学教导我们,我们的想法塑造我们的现实。如果你认为自己无能,你就会相应地行动。但如果你认识到你的能力和成就,你就会继续进步。"

他们还讨论了解决潜在创伤的重要性。迈克尔的暴力童年造成了酒精暂时掩盖的深层伤口。真正的康复需要处理这些经历。

"这就像灵魂的手术,"陈博士解释说。"痛苦但必要。你不能只是假装创伤没有发生。你必须面对它,理解它,并逐渐减少它对你的力量。"

迈克尔擦去眼中的泪水。"有些日子感觉不可能。痛苦如此之深。"

"我知道,"陈博士温柔地说。"但你并不孤单。我们正在一起挖掘。在这种痛苦的另一边是自由——摆脱成瘾、创伤和控制你生活的模式的自由。"

很快疗程结束了。当迈克尔准备离开时,陈博士给了他一个作业:每天写下三个成就,无论多么小。

"即使只是'我起床了'或'我今天没喝酒',"她解释说。"认识进步对于保持动力至关重要。"

在接下来的几个月里,迈克尔继续他的治疗。道路不是笔直的。他有挫折——强烈渴望的时刻,深度抑郁的日子。但他没有复发喝酒。他使用应对工具,联系支持者,并坚持下去。

肯定但逐渐地,事情改善了。他与妹妹的关系加深了。他在书店获得晋升。他开始和在支持小组认识的一个女人约会——一个叫莎拉的女人,她也在康复中,理解他的旅程。

开始治疗一年后,迈克尔站在陈博士办公室外,看着她看过许多次的同样的从黑暗到光明的天空过渡。但这次,他感觉不同。更轻松。更有能力。更有希望。

"好吧,"他微笑着想,"我还在这里。这本身就是一个成就。"

那天他的治疗疗程集中在庆祝他的进步和规划未来。陈博士明显感到骄傲。

"迈克尔,你取得了显著的进步,"她说。"从一个感到无能和害怕的人,你已经转变成一个有能力、有韧性和有希望的人。这不是运气——这是辛勤工作和承诺。"

"谢谢你从未放弃我,"迈克尔说,声音充满情感。"有些时候我外表清醒但内心暴力和黑暗。你帮我挖出了出路。"

"你做了挖掘,"陈博士温柔地纠正。"我只是提供了工具和保持了光明。"

当迈克尔离开治疗中心时,他拿出手机给莎拉发短信:"刚完成治疗。今天戒酒一年。想用高尔夫和晚餐庆祝吗?"

她的回复很快到来:"当然!为你感到骄傲。你是我最喜欢的人。"

迈克尔微笑了。黑暗的日子并没有完全过去——康复是一个持续的过程,他知道挑战仍会来临。但他已经获得了技能,建立了支持系统,并发展了面对任何来临事物的人格力量。

康复之路漫长而艰难,但也很美好。迈克尔终于充满信心、能力和希望地走在这条路上。
