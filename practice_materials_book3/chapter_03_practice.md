## Part 5: Grammar Focus

### Grammar Point 1: Gerunds vs. Infinitives

**Explanation**: Some verbs are followed by gerunds (-ing), others by infinitives (to + verb), and some by both with different meanings.

**Common patterns**:
- Gerund: finish, avoid, consider, suggest, enjoy, admit, deny
- Infinitive: want, need, decide, promise, refuse, agree, plan
- Both: start, begin, continue, like, love, hate

**Examples from the story**:
- "We're going to **conduct** proper research" (infinitive of purpose)
- "They **finished conducting** the research" (gerund after finish)
- "Emily **suggested focusing** on teachers" (gerund after suggest)
- "The team **decided to focus** on one problem" (infinitive after decide)

**Practice**: Choose the correct form.

1. Emily suggested ________ (conduct/to conduct/conducting) user research first.
2. The team decided ________ (focus/to focus/focusing) on teachers.
3. They wanted ________ (avoid/to avoid/avoiding) another failure.
4. Dr. Chen promised ________ (provide/to provide/providing) honest feedback.
5. Sarah considered ________ (change/to change/changing) her perspective.
6. They finished ________ (develop/to develop/developing) the product on time.
7. Alex refused ________ (make/to make/making) excuses for problems.
8. The team enjoyed ________ (celebrate/to celebrate/celebrating) their success.

### Grammar Point 2: Reported Speech

**Explanation**: When reporting what someone said, we typically shift tenses back and change pronouns/time expressions.

**Direct** → **Reported**
- Present → Past
- Past → Past Perfect
- Will → Would
- Can → Could
- "today" → "that day"
- "tomorrow" → "the next day"

**Examples from the story**:
- Direct: Emily said, "We need to conduct research."
- Reported: Emily said (that) they needed to conduct research.

**Practice**: Convert to reported speech.

1. Dr. Chen said, "I want to see measurable improvements."
   → Dr. Chen said ___________________________________

2. Sarah asked, "Are we abandoning our original vision?"
   → Sarah asked ___________________________________

3. Jake said, "I observed Mrs. Patterson's class last week."
   → Jake said ___________________________________

4. Emily told them, "Focus on solving one problem well."
   → Emily told them ___________________________________

5. David said, "You have accomplished something remarkable."
   → David said ___________________________________

### Grammar Point 3: Modal Verbs for Speculation (Past)

**Explanation**: Use modal verbs + have + past participle to speculate about past events.
- **must have** = almost certain (95% sure)
- **might/may/could have** = possible (50% sure)
- **can't/couldn't have** = impossible
- **should have** = expectation that wasn't met

**Examples**:
- "They must have worked very hard" (we see evidence)
- "It might have failed without the research" (speculation)
- "She can't have finished already" (seems impossible)
- "We should have listened to users earlier" (regret)

**Practice**: Complete with appropriate modal + have + past participle.

1. The team ________ (must/work) extremely hard to finish in six weeks.
2. Without Emily's research, they ________ (might/fail) again.
3. Dr. Chen ________ (must/be) impressed by their attitude to partner with them.
4. They ________ (should/conduct) user research from the beginning.
5. The teachers ________ (couldn't/finish) grading so quickly without the tool.

## Part 6: Discussion & Critical Thinking

### Discussion Questions (75-100 words each)

1. **User Research Ethics**: The team discovered teachers and students want different things. If you can only serve one group well, how do you ethically make that choice? What responsibility do you have to the group you don't serve?

2. **Strategic Pivots**: Sarah worried about "compromising their vision." When is changing strategy smart adaptation vs. losing your core mission? How can startups stay true to their values while being flexible?

3. **Partnership Dynamics**: Dr. Chen's three requirements were understanding, responsiveness, and responsibility (no excuses). Why are these more important than technical perfection? What does this tell us about successful partnerships?

4. **Time vs. Quality Trade-offs**: The team had only six weeks to build their product. How do you balance "good enough to launch" vs. "perfect"? What criteria should guide this decision?

5. **Failure as Teacher**: This chapter showed the team applying lessons from their Chapter 2 failure. Give an example of a failure in your life that taught you something valuable. How did it change your approach?

6. **User-Centered Design in Practice**: The team visited schools, observed classrooms, and interviewed teachers extensively. Why don't more companies do this? What prevents organizations from truly understanding their users?
