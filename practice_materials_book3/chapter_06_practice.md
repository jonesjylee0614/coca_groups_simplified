## Part 5: Grammar Focus

### Grammar Point 1: Modal Verbs for Possibility and Obligation

**Explanation**: We use modal verbs (could, might, would, should, must, can't) to express possibility, probability, and obligation.

**Examples from the story**:
- "We **could** have something genuinely unique." (possibility)
- "It **might** fail." (possibility)
- "You **should** test the assumption first." (advice/recommendation)
- "We **must** justify this investment." (obligation)
- "They **would** need approval for strategic initiatives." (conditional)

**Practice**:
Choose the correct modal verb:

1. If we pursue innovation, we (might / must) fail, but it's worth trying.
2. Rachel said they (could / should) build the framework in six months.
3. Large corporations (would / must) probably reject risky innovations.
4. We (can't / might) compete with giants through mere imitation.
5. David advised they (would / should) create a minimal prototype first.
6. The acquisition offer (could / must) give them financial security.
7. Emily said someone (might / must) monitor progress closely.
8. If they accept the offer, they (would / could) lose their autonomy.

### Grammar Point 2: Passive Voice with Modal Verbs

**Explanation**: We use passive voice with modals (modal + be + past participle) when the focus is on the action rather than who does it, or when the doer is unknown or unimportant.

**Examples from the story**:
- "The framework **could be constructed** in six months."
- "Features **can be copied** easily."
- "Strategic initiatives **would need to be approved** by the corporation."
- "The assumption **should be tested** before building the whole system."

**Practice**:
Rewrite these sentences in passive voice with modals:

1. Competitors can easily replicate standard features.
   → Standard features __________________________________.

2. They should test the prototype with real teachers.
   → The prototype __________________________________.

3. The corporation would approve only safe projects.
   → Only safe projects __________________________________.

4. We must monitor the project closely.
   → The project __________________________________.

5. Rachel could adapt the framework if assumptions proved false.
   → The framework __________________________________.

### Grammar Point 3: Conditional Sentences (Type 2 - Unreal Present)

**Explanation**: We use Type 2 conditionals (if + past simple, would + infinitive) to talk about unreal or hypothetical situations in the present or future.

**Examples from the story**:
- "If it **succeeded**, we'**d** have something genuinely unique."
- "If we **accepted** the offer, we **would** gain financial security but lose innovation ability."
- "If they **became** just another provider, they **would** lose their identity."

**Practice**:
Complete these conditional sentences:

1. If New Horizon ________ (copy) competitors, they ________ (become) ordinary.

2. If Rachel's framework ________ (work), they ________ (revolutionize) education.

3. If they ________ (accept) the acquisition, they ________ (need) approval for innovations.

4. If the team ________ (not embrace) innovation, they ________ (lose) their competitive edge.

5. If teachers ________ (not want) the adaptive system, the investment ________ (be) wasted.
