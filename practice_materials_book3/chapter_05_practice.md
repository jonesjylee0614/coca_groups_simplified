## Part 5: Grammar Focus

### Grammar Point 1: Comparative Structures (more... than, as... as)

**Explanation**: We use comparative structures to show differences or similarities between two things. Use "more + adjective + than" for comparisons and "as + adjective + as" for equality.

**Examples from the story**:
- "EduTech was **more aggressive than** New Horizon."
- "Their funding was **not as solid as** EduTech's."
- "Teachers valued relationships **more than** marketing."

**Practice**:
Complete with the correct comparative form:

1. EduTech's funding was ________ (large) than New Horizon's.
2. New Horizon's support was ________ (good) than TeachPro's.
3. The competition was not ________ (difficult) as they initially feared.
4. Their platform was ________ (sophisticated) than the imitation.
5. Being ethical was ________ (important) than winning quickly.

### Grammar Point 2: Modal Verbs for Decisions and Possibilities (could, should, might)

**Explanation**: Modal verbs express possibility, advice, and potential outcomes. "Could" shows possibility, "should" gives advice, and "might" indicates uncertainty.

**Examples from the story**:
- "We **could** expose their tactics publicly."
- "They **should** focus on relationships."
- "This **might** backfire on us."
- "We **could** easily look desperate."

**Practice**:
Choose the correct modal verb:

1. If they respond aggressively, it (could / should) damage their reputation.
2. Sarah suggested they (might / should) focus on product improvement.
3. Teachers (could / might) recognize the genuine versus the imitation.
4. We (should / could) trust our relationships with teachers.
5. EduTech's investors (might / should) become nervous about retention rates.

### Grammar Point 3: Reported Speech

**Explanation**: When reporting what someone said, we change the tense and pronouns. Direct speech: "I am worried." Reported speech: "She said she was worried."

**Examples from the story**:
- Direct: "We've decided to transition to a different platform."
- Reported: Dr. Miller said **they had decided** to transition.
- Direct: "They lack the resources to compete long-term."
- Reported: EduTech **implied that New Horizon lacked** resources.

**Practice**:
Convert these direct quotes to reported speech:

1. Marcus said, "We need to respond aggressively."
   Marcus said __________________________________________

2. Sarah warned, "This could backfire."
   Sarah warned __________________________________________

3. Dr. Miller explained, "Their representative made concerning comments."
   Dr. Miller explained __________________________________________

4. Mrs. Patterson told Alex, "My colleague is frustrated with TeachPro."
   Mrs. Patterson told Alex __________________________________________

5. David asked, "What kind of reputation do you want?"
   David asked __________________________________________

## Part 6: Discussion & Critical Thinking

### Discussion Questions

Discuss these questions with a partner or write your responses (50-100 words each):

1. **Ethical Competition**: Was Marcus initially wrong to want to expose EduTech's tactics? When is it appropriate to publicly call out unethical behavior versus taking the high road?

2. **Resource Allocation**: New Horizon had limited funding. They had to choose between marketing, product development, and relationship building. Which would you have prioritized and why?

3. **Imitation vs. Innovation**: Why do you think EduTech's imitation strategy ultimately failed? What does this teach us about competitive advantage?

4. **Values Under Pressure**: The team almost changed their approach under competitive pressure. How do companies maintain their values when threatened? Can you think of real-world examples?

5. **Long-term vs. Short-term**: EduTech focused on rapid market capture with aggressive tactics. New Horizon focused on steady relationship building. Which approach is more sustainable? Are there situations where each is appropriate?

6. **The Role of Competition**: David said competition forces you to decide who you want to be. Do you agree that competition can be beneficial even when it's threatening? How can competition make companies better?
