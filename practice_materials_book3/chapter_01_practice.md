**Examples from the story**:
- "We'**ll** need money to build this."
- "You **should** be happy."
- "They **must** hire more people."
- "**I** **might** lose the security I have now."

**Practice**:

4. New Horizon (could / must) change education if they succeed.
5. "You (should / might) try to call David," Sarah suggested.

**Examples from the story**:
