## 📖 Reading Passage: Questions That Matter

Daniel sat **across** from his **grandfather**, who was **now** **eighty** years **old**. They were in the **small** **living** **room** where Daniel had **spent** **countless** **hours** as a **child**.

"**Tell** me **something**," his **grandfather** said. "**What** do you **really** **want** from **life**?"

It was a **simple** **question**, but Daniel **found** it **hard** to **answer**. **What** **did** he **want**? **What** **mattered** **most**? He'd been so **focused** on his **career** that he'd **never** **stopped** to **ask** **himself** these **questions**.

"I don't **know**," Daniel **admitted**. "I **thought** I **knew**, but **now** I'm not **sure**."

His **grandfather** **smiled**. "**That**'s an **honest** **answer**. **Many** **people** **never** **even** **ask** the **question**. They just **keep** **moving** **without** knowing **where** they're **going** or **why**."

"**What** **about** you?" Daniel **asked**. "**What** did you **want** from **life**?"

"**Many** **things**," his **grandfather** replied. "But **over** **time**, I **learned** **that** **what** **matters** **most** are the **relationships** you **build**, the **love** you **give**, and the **person** you **become**. Everything **else** is **just** **noise**."

Daniel **thought** about this. He'd **spent** **years** chasing **success**, but had he been chasing the **right** **things**? **What** if the **most** **important** **things** weren't the ones he'd been **pursuing**?

"**Tell** me," his **grandfather** **continued**, "**what** **brings** you **joy**? Not **what** **should** bring you **joy**, but **what** **actually** **does**?"

Daniel **paused**. **What** **brought** him **joy**? Time with **family**. **Helping** **others**. **Creating** **something** **meaningful**. But he'd been so **busy** **working** that he'd had **little** **time** for **any** of these **things**.

"I **think** I've been **focused** on the **wrong** **things**," Daniel **said**.

"**That**'s **okay**," his **grandfather** replied. "**What** **matters** is **that** you're **asking** the **question** **now**. **It**'s **never** too **late** to **change** **direction**."

"But I'm **now** **thirty**-**five**," Daniel protested. "I've **already** **invested** so **much** in this **path**."

"And **what** **about** the **next** **thirty**-**five** **years**?" his **grandfather** **asked**. "Do you **want** to **spend** them the **same** **way**, or do you **want** **something** **different**?"

**That** **question** **hit** Daniel **hard**. **What** did he **want** for the **next** **half** of his **life**? More of the **same**, or **something** **more** **meaningful**?

"**Tell** me **what** you would do if you **weren't** **afraid**," his **grandfather** said.

Daniel **thought** about it. **What** would he do **without** **fear**? He'd **start** that **non**-**profit** he'd been **dreaming** **about**. He'd **spend** **more** **time** with **family**. He'd **live** according to his **values**, not his **fears**.

"**That**'s your **answer**," his **grandfather** said **simply**. "**What** you would do **without** **fear** – **that**'s **what** you **should** do."

**Now** Daniel **understood**. The **questions** **mattered** **more** than the **answers**. **What** do you **want**? **What** brings you **joy**? **What** would you do **without** **fear**? These weren't **just** **questions** – they were **guides** for **living**.

"Thank you," Daniel said to his **grandfather**. "**That** conversation **changed** everything."

His **grandfather** smiled. "**That**'s **what** **grandfathers** are for."
