## Reading Passage

### Part 1: The User Research Mission

The **morning** after their **midnight** redesign **session**, Emily gathered the team. She had **obviously** been planning this **carefully**.

"**Here's** our new **mission**," she said, writing on the whiteboard. "**For** the **next** two weeks, we're not **writing** any code. We're going to **conduct** proper user **research**."

Jake looked worried. "But we **only** have six months **total**, and three are **already** gone. Can we **afford** to **spend** two weeks just **talking** to **people**?"

"We can't **afford** not to," Emily replied **firmly**. "The **traditional** **approach** of building **first** and **testing** **later** has **already** failed **us** **once**. This **time**, we're going to **discover** what **users** **truly** **need** **before** we build **anything**."

Alex **appreciated** Emily's confidence, but he **understood** Jake's **concern**. Their **budget** was **limited**, and David **expected** **progress**. **Nevertheless**, he **trusted** Emily's **experience**.

"**OK**," Alex said. "What's the **plan**?"

Emily **revealed** a detailed **research** **strategy**. They would **visit** five **different** schools, **interview** at **least** twenty teachers, **observe** actual classroom **operations**, and **conduct** **focus** groups with students. They would **examine** how teachers **currently** **handled** lesson planning, **track** how students **actually** **learned**, and **identify** the **specific** **tasks** that caused the most **suffering**.

"We're going to **split** up," Emily **continued**. "Sarah and Jake, you'll **focus** on the **technical** side—what **devices** and **platforms** schools **currently** **use**, what their **internet** **access** is **like**, what **limitations** they **face**. Alex and I will **focus** on the **human** side—what teachers and students **actually** **need**, not what we **assume** they **need**."

**Over** the **following** two weeks, the team **engaged** in **intense** **research**. They **traveled** to **urban** schools and **suburban** schools, **wealthy** **districts** and **poor** ones. They **attended** classes, sat in teacher **meetings**, and **observed** **hundreds** of students **learning**.

What they **discovered** was both **amazing** and **challenging**.

### Part 2: The Unexpected Discovery

On a **Friday** **afternoon**, the team gathered to **review** their **findings**. Emily had **collected** **extensive** **notes**, **organized** them into **patterns**, and **prepared** to **share** the **results**.

"**Alright**," she began, **expressing** **obvious** **excitement** but also **concern**. "I need you all to **listen** **carefully** to this, **because** it's going to **change** **everything** we **thought** we **knew**."

She **posted** several large **sheets** of **paper** on the **wall**, **containing** quotes from teachers and students.

"**Here's** what we **learned**: teachers and students want **completely** **different** things. And **currently**, we're trying to serve both, which means we're **effectively** serving **neither**."

Sarah sat **forward**. "What do you **mean**?"

Emily pointed to the **first** **sheet**. "Teachers want **tools** that help them **manage** their classroom **tasks** more **efficiently**. They're **suffering** from **overwhelming** **administrative** **work**. They **spend** **hours** grading, **tracking** **student** **progress**, **planning** lessons, **managing** **behavior**. They're **exhausted**. What they want is something that **handles** the **boring** **administrative** **stuff** so they can **focus** on **actually** **teaching**."

She **moved** to the **second** **sheet**. "But students? They don't **care** about **administrative** **efficiency**. They want learning to be **engaging**, **fun**, **social**. They want to **connect** with their **peers**, to **express** **themselves**, to see **immediate** **results**. They're **bored** with **traditional** **education** and want something **totally** **fresh**."

Jake **scratched** his **head**. "So what do we do? **Try** to **satisfy** both?"

"That's what every **failed** education **technology** company **attempts**," Emily said **seriously**. "They **try** to be **everything** to **everybody**, and **eventually** they **satisfy** **nobody**. We need to make a **critical** **choice**: **who** is our **actual** **customer**?"

The room went **silent**. This was the **kind** of **decision** that could **determine** the **entire** **future** of their company.

**Finally**, Alex spoke. "What does your **research** **suggest**?"

Emily **took** a **deep** breath. "**Here's** what I **learned** by **examining** **successful** education **products**: the **person** who **pays** for the **product** is **rarely** the **person** who **uses** it. In schools, **administrators** and **principals** make **purchasing** **decisions**. And what matters to them? They want to see **measurable** **improvements** in **student** **performance**, and they want **tools** that **reduce** teacher **workload** and **stress**."

Sarah **interrupted**. "So you're **saying** we should **focus** on teachers, not students?"

"I'm **saying** we should **focus** on **solving** a **specific**, **measurable** **problem** for teachers, which will **indirectly** **benefit** students. If we can **genuinely** help teachers be more **effective**, students will **naturally** **learn** **better**."

Alex **considered** this **carefully**. "But that's not what we **originally** **imagined**. We **started** this because we wanted to **directly** **transform** how students **learn**."

"I know," Emily said gently. "But **sometimes** the **path** to your **ultimate** **goal** goes through a **different** **direction** than you **expected**. We can **still** **transform** education—we just need to be **smart** about our **approach**."

### Part 3: The Partnership Opportunity

**While** the team **struggled** with this **strategic** **decision**, an **unexpected** **opportunity** **arrived**. Dr. Patricia Chen, **principal** of Riverside Middle School, **contacted** them **directly**.

"I heard about your **research** **visits**," she said when Alex **met** her at a **coffee** shop. "Ms. Rodriguez told me about your **failed** **test**, but also about how **willing** you were to **admit** your **mistakes** and **learn**. That **attitude** **impressed** me."

Alex felt both **embarrassed** and **hopeful**. "We **definitely** made **mistakes**. We're **trying** to do **better**."

Dr. Chen **smiled**. "**Most** **technology** companies **promise** **amazing** **solutions** but **refuse** to **listen** to **actual** **educators**. You're **different**. So I want to **propose** something: become our **partner** for a **pilot** **program**. Work **directly** with our teachers for the **next** **semester**. **We'll** give you **honest** **feedback**, and you can **develop** your **product** **based** on **real** **needs**."

"What would you **expect** from **us**?" Alex asked.

"**First**, **understanding**. **Truly** **understand** what our teachers **face** every **day**. **Second**, **responsiveness**. When we **identify** **problems**, **fix** them **quickly**. **Third**, **responsibility**. If something **doesn't** work, **admit** it and **improve** it, don't make **excuses**."

"We can **absolutely** do that," Alex said **immediately**. Then he **paused**. "But I should be **honest** with you. We're **currently** **reviewing** our **entire** **strategy**. We **might** **change** our **product** **focus** **significantly**."

"**Even** **better**," Dr. Chen said. "That shows you're **truly** **learning**. **Here's** what I **care** about: by the **end** of this **semester**, I want to see **measurable** **improvements** in our teachers' **ability** to **handle** their **workload**, which should **eventually** **translate** into **better** **student** **engagement**. How you **achieve** that is up to you."

They **established** a **partnership** **agreement** that **afternoon**. Riverside Middle School would **grant** New Horizon **access** to work with five teachers for a **trial** **period**, and the team would **deliver** a working **solution** within six weeks—just as their six-month funding **period** **ended**.

The **pressure** was **intense**, but the **opportunity** was **valuable**.

### Part 4: Difficult Choices and Team Tension

Back at the office, the team **faced** their most **critical** **decision** yet. They had a **clear** **direction** from their **research**, a **promising** **partnership**, and an **urgent** **deadline**. But they also had **limited** **resources** and **conflicting** **visions**.

Sarah was **particularly** **concerned**. "I **understand** the **logic** of **focusing** on teachers," she said during a **heated** team **meeting**. "But it feels like we're **compromising** our **original** **vision**. We **started** this to **revolutionize** learning for students, not to build **administrative** **software** for teachers."

"It's not **compromise**," Emily **argued**. "It's **strategy**. We're **taking** a **necessary** **step** to **establish** our **presence** in schools. **Once** we **prove** our **value** to teachers and **principals**, we'll have the **trust** and **access** to **eventually** **transform** student learning **directly**."

"But what if we **never** **reach** that **eventually**?" Sarah pressed. "What if we become just **another** **boring** **administrative** **tool**?"

Alex **understood** both **perspectives**. This was the **kind** of **leadership** **challenge** David had **warned** him about—**managing** **strategic** **trade-offs** with no **perfect** answer.

"**Let's** **think** about this **differently**," Alex **proposed**. "We have **exactly** six weeks **until** David's **deadline** and the **end** of Dr. Chen's **semester**. What if we **commit** to **delivering** something **valuable** for teachers **now**, while **secretly** **planning** for Phase Two, where we **expand** to **directly** **serve** students?"

Jake, who had been **quiet**, **suddenly** spoke up. "**Actually**, I **don't** think these **goals** are as **separate** as we think. When I **observed** Mrs. Patterson's class last week, she **spent** **so** much **time** **managing** **administrative** **tasks** that she could **barely** **engage** with **individual** students. If we **help** her **handle** the **admin** **stuff** **faster**, she'll have **more** **time** for **actual** **teaching**. The students will **benefit** **indirectly**."

Sarah **considered** this. "So we're not **abandoning** students—we're just **recognizing** that helping teachers **is** helping students?"

"**Exactly**," Emily said, **obviously** **relieved**. "And **here's** the **best** part: if we **focus** **now** on **solving** a **specific**, **measurable** **problem**, we'll **actually** have **enough** **time** to build something that **works**. If we **try** to **solve** **everything** at **once**, we'll **fail** **again**."

**Slowly**, the team **reached** **agreement**. They would **focus** their **launch** **product** on helping teachers **efficiently** **manage** three **specific** **tasks**: grading **assignments**, **tracking** student **progress**, and **identifying** **students** who needed **additional** **attention**. It wasn't **revolutionary**, but it was **necessary** and **achievable**.

Sarah **finally** **smiled**. "**OK**. **Let's** do this. But I'm **holding** everyone to Jake's **promise**—this is Phase One, not our **final** **vision**."

"**Deal**," Alex said. "And I **promise** you, Sarah, we **will** **eventually** build the **revolutionary** student learning **experience** we **originally** **imagined**. But **first**, we need to **survive** and **establish** **trust**."

### Part 5: The Sprint to Launch

The **next** six weeks were the most **intense** **period** any of them had **experienced**. They worked with the five Riverside teachers **daily**, **conducting** **regular** check-ins, **observing** their **workflow**, and **immediately** **adjusting** their **product** **based** on **feedback**.

Jake **led** the **technical** **development**, **essentially** **living** at the office. His **screen** **rarely** went **dark** as he **coded** new **features**, **fixed** **bugs**, and **integrated** **teacher** **suggestions**. Sarah worked **alongside** him, **handling** the **complex** **database** **architecture** that would **track** **student** **performance** **across** **multiple** classes and **semesters**.

Emily **maintained** **close** **communication** with Dr. Chen and the **participating** teachers, **ensuring** everyone **understood** the **development** **timeline** and **managing** **expectations**. She **conducted** **weekly** **surveys** to **measure** teacher **satisfaction** and **stress** **levels**, **using** this **data** to **prioritize** which **features** to build **first**.

Alex **handled** the **business** side: **maintaining** the **relationship** with David, **managing** their **limited** **budget**, and **beginning** to **establish** **connections** with other **potential** **partner** schools. He also took **responsibility** for team **morale**, **organizing** **weekly** team **dinners** and **ensuring** **nobody** **burned** **out** completely.

Dr. Chen proved to be a **valuable** **partner**. She **attended** their **progress** **meetings**, provided **honest** **feedback**, and **protected** the team from **excessive** **demands** from other teachers who wanted to **participate**.

"**Remember**," she told them during one **particularly** **stressful** **week**, "**perfection** isn't the **goal**. **Improvement** is. If your **tool** **saves** each teacher just thirty minutes per **week**, that's **valuable**. Don't **try** to **solve** **every** **problem**—just **solve** **one** or two problems **really** **well**."

This **advice** proved **critical**. When the team was **tempted** to **add** more **features**, Emily would **remind** them: "**Focus**. **Depth** over **breadth**. **Excellence** in a **narrow** **domain** **beats** **mediocrity** **across** everything."

Three days before the **scheduled** **launch**, they **conducted** a **final** **test** with all five teachers. The team watched **nervously** as Mrs. Patterson **used** the **grading** **feature** for the **first** **time** with an **actual** class **assignment**.

She uploaded the student **papers**, set her grading **criteria**, and watched as the **system** **highlighted** **common** **errors**, **suggested** **feedback**, and **tracked** which students were **struggling** with **particular** **concepts**.

After thirty minutes, she looked up with an **expression** Alex **couldn't** **initially** **read**. Then she **smiled**.

"This just **saved** me two **hours**," she said **simply**. "And more **importantly**, it **showed** me **patterns** I **wouldn't** have **noticed** **manually**. Three of my students are all **struggling** with the **same** **concept**—now I can **address** that **specifically** **tomorrow**."

The team **nearly** **cried** with **relief** and **joy**.

### Part 6: Launch Day

The **official** **launch** **happened** on a **cold** **Friday** **morning** in **December**, **exactly** six months after David had **provided** their seed funding. The **entire** team **gathered** early at the office, **running** **final** checks, **testing** the **servers**, and **preparing** for the formal **presentation** to Dr. Chen and her **staff**.

David **arrived** for the **occasion**, his **first** **visit** to the office since their **initial** **agreement**. He walked **around** the **space**, **observing** the **evidence** of their **hard** **work**: **whiteboard** **covered** in **notes**, **coffee** cups **everywhere**, Jake **sleeping** under his desk after an **all-night** **coding** **session**.

"This looks like a **real** **company** now," he said, **obviously** **pleased**. "Not just an **idea**—an **actual** **operation**."

At 10 AM, they **presented** their **product** to Riverside Middle School's **entire** **faculty**. Emily **led** the **presentation**, **demonstrating** the **key** **features** while Sarah **handled** the **technical** **details** and Jake **answered** **questions** about **implementation**.

The teachers asked **tough** **questions**. Would it work with their **existing** **systems**? What about **student** **privacy**? Could it **handle** different **subject** **areas**? What if they **discovered** **bugs**?

Alex **answered** **honestly**: "We've designed it to **integrate** with your **current** **platforms**. We take **privacy** **seriously**—no **student** **data** **leaves** your **district**'s **servers**. It's been **tested** primarily in **core** **academic** **subjects**, but we're **willing** to **adapt** it for other **areas**. And yes, there **will** **probably** be **bugs**—we **promise** to **fix** them **quickly** and **communicate** **honestly** about any **issues**."

Dr. Chen stood up. "I've been **working** with this team for six weeks. What **impresses** me most isn't their **technology**—it's their **attitude**. They **listen**. They **adapt**. They **admit** **mistakes** and **learn** from them. That's **why** I'm **recommending** we **expand** this **pilot** **program** to **all** **interested** teachers **next** **semester**."

The **faculty** **voted**, and the **majority** agreed to **adopt** New Horizon's **system**.

As the **meeting** **ended**, Alex felt **something** he hadn't **experienced** in months: **genuine** **confidence** that they were **finally** on the **right** **track**.

### Part 7: Reflection and Next Steps

That **evening**, the team **celebrated** at a **modest** **restaurant** (**their** **budget** was **still** **limited**). David **joined** them, **raising** a **glass** of wine.

"**Here's** what you've **accomplished**," David said. "Six months ago, you had an **idea** and **passion**. Three months ago, you **experienced** **devastating** **failure**. **Today**, you have an **actual** **product**, **paying** **customers**, and a **proven** **ability** to **execute**. That's **remarkable**."

"We **still** have **so** much to do," Sarah said. "This is just Phase One. We **haven't** **even** begun to **address** **student** learning **directly**."

"**True**," David **acknowledged**. "But you've **established** **something** **crucial**: **trust** and **credibility**. You've **proven** you can **deliver** **value**. **Now** you can **leverage** that to **raise** **additional** **funding**, **expand** your team, and **eventually** **pursue** your **bigger** **vision**."

Alex looked **around** the **table** at his team. Jake, **exhausted** but **happy**. Sarah, **still** **skeptical** about their **strategic** **direction** but **satisfied** with their **technical** **achievement**. Emily, **obviously** **proud** of the **process** she'd **led** them through.

"**Here's** what I've **learned** these past six months," Alex said **seriously**. "Building a company isn't about having the **perfect** **idea** or being the **smartest** people in the room. It's about being **willing** to **learn**, to **change** **direction** when **necessary**, to **listen** to users, and to **support** **each** **other** through **failures** and **successes**."

"**Also** pizza," Jake added **sleepily**. "**Definitely** **involves** a lot of pizza."

**Everybody** **laughed**, and the **tension** that had **built** up over six months **finally** **broke** **completely**.

As they **left** the **restaurant** that **night**, walking through the **cold** **December** **streets**, Alex **realized** something **important**: they had **survived** their **trial** **period**. But more **significantly**, they had **transformed** from a **couple** of **hopeful** **dreamers** into a **real** **team** with a **real** **product** serving **real** users.

The **journey** was **far** from **over**. They would **face** more **challenges**, more **failures**, more **difficult** **decisions**. But now they had something **valuable**: **experience**, **partnership**, **trust**, and a **proven** **process** for **turning** **failure** into **learning**.

**Tomorrow**, they would start **planning** Phase Two. But **tonight**, they could **simply** **appreciate** what they had **built** **together**.

New Horizon was no **longer** just an **idea**. It was **real**. And that was **worth** **celebrating**.

## Chinese Translation - 中文翻译

### 第一部分：用户研究使命

在他们午夜重新设计会议之后的早上，Emily召集了团队。她显然已经仔细计划了这一切。

"这是我们的新使命，"她说，在白板上写字。"在接下来的两周里，我们不写任何代码。我们要进行适当的用户研究。"

Jake看起来很担心。"但我们总共只有六个月，三个月已经过去了。我们能负担得起花两周时间只是和人们交谈吗？"

"我们负担不起不这样做，"Emily坚定地回答。"先建造后测试的传统方法已经让我们失败过一次了。这次，我们要在建造任何东西之前发现用户真正需要什么。"

Alex欣赏Emily的信心，但他理解Jake的担忧。他们的预算有限，David期待进展。尽管如此，他相信Emily的经验。

"好的，"Alex说。"计划是什么？"

Emily展示了详细的研究策略。他们将访问五所不同的学校，至少采访二十名教师，观察实际的课堂运作，并与学生进行焦点小组讨论。他们将检查教师目前如何处理课程规划，跟踪学生实际如何学习，并确定导致最多痛苦的具体任务。

"我们要分开，"Emily继续说。"Sarah和Jake，你们专注于技术方面——学校目前使用什么设备和平台，他们的互联网访问如何，他们面临什么限制。Alex和我将专注于人的方面——教师和学生实际需要什么，而不是我们假设他们需要什么。"

在接下来的两周里，团队进行了深入的研究。他们前往城市学校和郊区学校，富裕地区和贫困地区。他们参加课程，参加教师会议，观察数百名学生学习。

他们发现的东西既令人惊讶又具有挑战性。

### 第二部分：意外的发现

在一个星期五下午，团队聚在一起回顾他们的发现。Emily收集了大量笔记，将它们组织成模式，并准备分享结果。

"好的，"她开始说，表达明显的兴奋但也有担忧。"我需要你们都仔细听这个，因为它将改变我们认为我们知道的一切。"

她在墙上贴了几张大纸，包含来自教师和学生的引言。

"我们学到了什么：教师和学生想要完全不同的东西。目前，我们试图服务于两者，这意味着我们实际上两者都没有服务好。"

Sarah向前坐。"你是什么意思？"

Emily指着第一张纸。"教师想要帮助他们更有效地管理课堂任务的工具。他们因压倒性的行政工作而痛苦。他们花费数小时评分，跟踪学生进度，规划课程，管理行为。他们筋疲力尽。他们想要的是处理无聊的行政事务的东西，这样他们就可以专注于实际教学。"

她移到第二张纸。"但学生呢？他们不在乎行政效率。他们想要学习是引人入胜的、有趣的、社交的。他们想与同伴联系，表达自己，看到即时结果。他们对传统教育感到无聊，想要完全新鲜的东西。"

Jake挠头。"那么我们该怎么办？试图满足两者？"

"那是每个失败的教育技术公司都尝试做的事情，"Emily认真地说。"他们试图成为每个人的一切，最终他们不能满足任何人。我们需要做出一个关键的选择：谁是我们的实际客户？"

房间安静下来。这是可以决定他们公司整个未来的决定。

最后，Alex说话了。"你的研究建议什么？"

Emily深吸了一口气。"我通过检查成功的教育产品学到了什么：为产品付费的人很少是使用它的人。在学校里，管理人员和校长做出购买决策。对他们来说重要的是什么？他们想看到学生表现的可衡量改进，他们想要减少教师工作量和压力的工具。"

Sarah打断道。"所以你说我们应该专注于教师，而不是学生？"

"我说我们应该专注于为教师解决一个具体的、可衡量的问题，这将间接使学生受益。如果我们能真正帮助教师更有效，学生自然会学得更好。"

Alex仔细考虑了这一点。"但这不是我们最初想象的。我们开始这个是因为我们想直接改变学生的学习方式。"

"我知道，"Emily温柔地说。"但有时通往你最终目标的道路经过与你预期不同的方向。我们仍然可以改变教育——我们只需要对我们的方法保持聪明。"

### 第三部分：合作机会

当团队为这个战略决策苦苦挣扎时，一个意外的机会到来了。Riverside中学的校长Patricia Chen博士直接联系了他们。

"我听说了你们的研究访问，"当Alex在咖啡店见到她时她说。"Rodriguez女士告诉了我你们的失败测试，但也告诉我你们愿意承认错误和学习。这种态度给我留下了深刻印象。"

Alex既感到尴尬又充满希望。"我们确实犯了错误。我们正在努力做得更好。"

Chen博士微笑着。"大多数技术公司承诺惊人的解决方案，但拒绝倾听实际的教育工作者。你们不同。所以我想提议一些事情：成为我们试点项目的合作伙伴。下学期直接与我们的教师合作。我们会给你们诚实的反馈，你们可以根据真实需求开发你们的产品。"

"你期望我们做什么？"Alex问。

"首先，理解。真正理解我们的教师每天面临什么。第二，响应性。当我们发现问题时，快速修复它们。第三，责任。如果某些东西不起作用，承认它并改进它，不要找借口。"

"我们绝对可以做到这一点，"Alex立即说。然后他停顿了一下。"但我应该对你诚实。我们目前正在审查我们的整个战略。我们可能会显著改变我们的产品重点。"

"更好，"Chen博士说。"这表明你们真正在学习。我关心的是：到本学期结束时，我想看到我们教师处理工作量能力的可衡量改进，这最终应该转化为更好的学生参与度。你们如何实现这一目标由你们决定。"

那天下午他们建立了合作协议。Riverside中学将授予New Horizon与五名教师合作的试用期访问权限，团队将在六周内交付一个有效的解决方案——正好是他们六个月资金期结束的时候。

压力很大，但机会很宝贵。

### 第四部分：艰难的选择和团队紧张

回到办公室，团队面临他们最关键的决定。他们有来自研究的明确方向，一个有前途的合作伙伴关系，和一个紧迫的截止日期。但他们也有有限的资源和相互冲突的愿景。

Sarah特别担心。"我理解专注于教师的逻辑，"她在一次激烈的团队会议上说。"但感觉我们正在妥协我们的原始愿景。我们开始这个是为了革新学生的学习，而不是为教师构建行政软件。"

"这不是妥协，"Emily争论道。"这是战略。我们正在采取必要的步骤在学校建立我们的存在。一旦我们证明我们对教师和校长的价值，我们将拥有信任和访问权限，最终直接改变学生学习。"

"但如果我们永远不会达到那个最终呢？"Sarah追问。"如果我们成为另一个无聊的行政工具呢？"

Alex理解两种观点。这是David警告过他的那种领导挑战——在没有完美答案的情况下管理战略权衡。

"让我们换个方式思考这个问题，"Alex提议。"我们离David的截止日期和Chen博士学期结束正好还有六周。如果我们承诺现在为教师提供有价值的东西，同时秘密计划第二阶段，我们扩展到直接服务学生，怎么样？"

一直保持安静的Jake突然说话了。"实际上，我不认为这些目标像我们想的那样分离。当我上周观察Patterson女士的课时，她花了这么多时间管理行政任务，几乎无法与个别学生互动。如果我们帮助她更快地处理行政事务，她将有更多时间进行实际教学。学生将间接受益。"

Sarah考虑了这一点。"所以我们不是放弃学生——我们只是认识到帮助教师就是帮助学生？"

"完全正确，"Emily说，显然松了一口气。"这是最好的部分：如果我们现在专注于解决一个具体的、可衡量的问题，我们实际上有足够的时间建造一些有效的东西。如果我们试图一次解决所有问题，我们会再次失败。"

慢慢地，团队达成了共识。他们将把发布产品重点放在帮助教师有效管理三个具体任务上：评分作业，跟踪学生进度，以及识别需要额外关注的学生。这不是革命性的，但这是必要的和可实现的。

Sarah终于笑了。"好的。让我们这样做。但我要让每个人都遵守Jake的承诺——这是第一阶段，不是我们的最终愿景。"

"成交，"Alex说。"我向你保证，Sarah，我们最终会建造我们最初想象的革命性学生学习体验。但首先，我们需要生存并建立信任。"

### 第五部分：冲刺到发布

接下来的六周是他们任何人经历过的最紧张的时期。他们每天与五位Riverside教师合作，进行定期检查，观察他们的工作流程，并根据反馈立即调整他们的产品。

Jake领导技术开发，基本上住在办公室。他的屏幕很少变暗，因为他编码新功能，修复错误，并整合教师建议。Sarah与他一起工作，处理复杂的数据库架构，该架构将跟踪多个班级和学期的学生表现。

Emily与Chen博士和参与的教师保持密切沟通，确保每个人都理解开发时间表并管理期望。她进行每周调查以衡量教师满意度和压力水平，使用这些数据优先考虑首先构建哪些功能。

Alex处理商业方面：维护与David的关系，管理他们有限的预算，并开始与其他潜在的合作伙伴学校建立联系。他还负责团队士气，组织每周团队晚餐，确保没有人完全精疲力竭。

Chen博士被证明是一个宝贵的合作伙伴。她参加他们的进度会议，提供诚实的反馈，并保护团队免受想要参与的其他教师的过度要求。

"记住，"她在一个特别紧张的一周告诉他们，"完美不是目标。改进才是。如果你们的工具每周为每位教师节省三十分钟，那就很有价值。不要试图解决每个问题——只要真正解决好一两个问题。"

这个建议被证明是关键的。当团队想要添加更多功能时，Emily会提醒他们："专注。深度胜于广度。狭窄领域的卓越胜过所有方面的平庸。"

在计划发布前三天，他们与所有五位教师进行了最终测试。团队紧张地看着Patterson女士第一次使用评分功能处理实际的课堂作业。

她上传了学生论文，设置了她的评分标准，并看着系统突出显示常见错误，建议反馈，并跟踪哪些学生在特定概念上苦苦挣扎。

三十分钟后，她抬起头，Alex最初无法解读的表情。然后她微笑了。

"这刚刚为我节省了两个小时，"她简单地说。"更重要的是，它向我展示了我手动不会注意到的模式。我的三个学生都在同一个概念上苦苦挣扎——现在我可以明天专门解决这个问题。"

团队几乎因为宽慰和喜悦而哭泣。

### 第六部分：发布日

正式发布发生在十二月的一个寒冷的星期五早上，正好是David提供种子资金六个月后。整个团队一大早就聚集在办公室，进行最后检查，测试服务器，并准备向Chen博士和她的员工进行正式演示。

David为这个场合到来，这是自他们最初协议以来他第一次访问办公室。他在空间里走来走去，观察他们努力工作的证据：白板上覆盖着笔记，到处都是咖啡杯，Jake在通宵编码后睡在他的桌子下面。

"这现在看起来像一个真正的公司，"他说，显然很高兴。"不仅仅是一个想法——一个实际的运作。"

上午10点，他们向Riverside中学的全体教师展示了他们的产品。Emily主导了演示，展示关键功能，而Sarah处理技术细节，Jake回答关于实施的问题。

教师们问了一些棘手的问题。它会与他们现有的系统一起工作吗？学生隐私呢？它能处理不同的学科领域吗？如果他们发现错误怎么办？

Alex诚实地回答："我们设计它与你们当前的平台集成。我们认真对待隐私——没有学生数据离开你们地区的服务器。它主要在核心学术科目中进行了测试，但我们愿意为其他领域调整它。是的，可能会有错误——我们承诺快速修复它们，并诚实地沟通任何问题。"

Chen博士站起来。"我与这个团队合作了六周。最让我印象深刻的不是他们的技术——而是他们的态度。他们倾听。他们适应。他们承认错误并从中学习。这就是为什么我建议我们下学期将这个试点项目扩展到所有感兴趣的教师。"

教师们投票，大多数人同意采用New Horizon的系统。

随着会议结束，Alex感受到了几个月来他没有经历过的东西：真正的信心，他们终于走在正确的轨道上。

### 第七部分：反思和下一步

那天晚上，团队在一家普通餐厅庆祝（他们的预算仍然有限）。David加入了他们，举起一杯酒。

"这是你们取得的成就，"David说。"六个月前，你们有一个想法和激情。三个月前，你们经历了毁灭性的失败。今天，你们有一个实际的产品，付费客户，以及经过验证的执行能力。这是了不起的。"

"我们还有这么多要做的，"Sarah说。"这只是第一阶段。我们甚至还没有开始直接解决学生学习问题。"

"是的，"David承认。"但你们建立了一些至关重要的东西：信任和可信度。你们已经证明你们可以提供价值。现在你们可以利用这一点筹集额外资金，扩大你们的团队，最终追求你们更大的愿景。"

Alex环顾桌子看着他的团队。Jake，筋疲力尽但快乐。Sarah，对他们的战略方向仍然持怀疑态度，但对他们的技术成就感到满意。Emily，显然为她引导他们经历的过程感到自豪。

"这是我这六个月学到的，"Alex认真地说。"建立一家公司不是关于有完美的想法或成为房间里最聪明的人。而是关于愿意学习，在必要时改变方向，倾听用户，并在失败和成功中相互支持。"

"还有披萨，"Jake睡意朦胧地补充道。"绝对涉及很多披萨。"

每个人都笑了，六个月积累的紧张终于完全打破了。

当他们那晚离开餐厅，走过寒冷的十二月街道时，Alex意识到一些重要的事情：他们已经度过了他们的试用期。但更重要的是，他们已经从几个充满希望的梦想家转变为一个拥有真实产品服务真实用户的真实团队。

旅程远未结束。他们将面临更多挑战，更多失败，更多艰难的决定。但现在他们有一些宝贵的东西：经验，合作伙伴关系，信任，以及将失败转化为学习的经过验证的过程。

明天，他们将开始计划第二阶段。但今晚，他们可以简单地欣赏他们一起建造的东西。

New Horizon不再只是一个想法。它是真实的。这值得庆祝。
