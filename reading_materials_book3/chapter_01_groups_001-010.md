## Reading Passage

### Part 1: The Last Day

**It** was **the** **first** **day** of spring, **and** Alex Chen sat at **his** desk watching **the** clock. Five **years**—that's **how** **long** **he** had been working at TechCorp, **one** of **the** **most** successful software companies in **the** **nation**. **He** should have been happy. **He** was making good **money**, living in **a** nice **house**, **and** his **family** thought **he** had **the** **best** **job** in **the** **world**.

**But** something was **wrong**.

"**You** look like **you** want **to** **go** somewhere **else**," said Jake, his coworker, walking **by** with **a** cup of coffee.

"**Maybe** **I** **do**," Alex replied, turning **away** **from** **the** computer screen.

**He** didn't **know** **why**, **but** **for** months now, every **day** felt **the** **same**. **He** would **come** **to** **the** office, **work** **on** code **that** nobody seemed **to** **really** **need**, **and** **then** **go** **home**. **There** had **to** **be** **more** **to** **life** **than** **this**.

"**What** would **you** **do** **if** **you** could **do** **anything**?" Jake asked, leaning **against** **the** desk.

Alex thought **about** **it** **for** **a** **minute**. "**I** **think** **I'd** **make** something **that** actually helps **people** **learn**. Something **different**. **You** **know**, education **is** still stuck in **the** past. **We** **have** **all** **this** technology, **but** schools **and** students **don't** **really** **use** **it** **well**."

Jake laughed. "**That's** **a** **big** **problem** **to** solve. **But** hey, **if** **anyone** **can** **do** **it**, **maybe** **it's** **you**."

**After** Jake walked **away**, Alex sat **there** thinking. **Why** **not**? **Why** **not** **try** **to** **create** something **that** could **actually** **change** **people's** lives? **Yes**, **it** would **be** hard. **Yes**, **he** might **lose** **the** security **he** had **now**. **But** what **if** **he** didn't **try**? What **if** **he** spent **the** **next** ten **years** here, doing **the** **same** **thing**, **and** **then** looked **back** **with** regret?

**That** afternoon, Alex **made** **a** **decision**. **He** walked **into** **his** boss's office.

"**I** **need** **to** **talk** **to** **you** **about** something **important**," Alex said.

His boss looked **up** **from** **his** computer. "Sure, **sit** **down**. **What's** going **on**?"

"**I'm** leaving TechCorp. **I** want **to** **start** **my** **own** **company**."

**There** was **a** **long** silence. **Then** his boss spoke. "**You** **know**, **we** **think** **you're** **one** of **our** **best** **people** here. **We** **can** give **you** **a** higher position, **more** **money**..."

"**It's** **not** **about** **money**," Alex said. "**It's** **about** doing something **I** **really** believe in."

His boss nodded slowly. "**I** **understand**. **I** felt **that** way **once** **too**. **Well**, **if** **that's** what **you** **need** **to** **do**, **then** **I** wish **you** **all** **the** **best**. **When** **do** **you** want **to** **leave**?"

"**Two** weeks. **I'll** **make** sure everything **is** finished before **I** **go**."

**As** Alex walked **out** of **the** office, **he** felt both scared **and** excited. **He** had **just** **changed** **his** whole **life** in five minutes.

### Part 2: The Coffee Shop Meeting

**Three** days **later**, Alex was sitting in **a** coffee **shop** downtown, waiting **for** someone **he** had met online. Her **name** was Sarah Martinez, **and** **she** had been writing **about** new ways **to** **use** technology in education. **From** what Alex could **tell**, **she** had **the** **same** ideas **he** did.

"**Are** **you** Alex?" **a** **young** **woman** asked, walking **up** **to** his **table**.

"**Yes**! **You** **must** **be** Sarah. **Thank** **you** **for** meeting **me**."

**They** sat **down**, **and** Sarah immediately started talking. "**So** **I** read your email. **You** said **you** want **to** build **a** **new** **kind** of education **system**. **Tell** **me** **more** **about** **that**."

**For** **the** **next** **hour**, **they** talked **about** everything. Alex explained **how** **he** thought students **should** **be** **able** **to** **learn** at **their** **own** pace, **how** teachers needed **better** tools, **and** **how** technology could **help** **but** **only** **if** **it** was done **right**.

Sarah was nodding **the** whole **time**. "**Yes**! **That's** exactly what **I've** been saying! **I've** been working **on** **some** ideas **for** **this**. **I** **actually** built **a** small **program** **that** might **show** what **we're** talking **about**."

**She** pulled **out** her laptop **and** **showed** **him**. **On** **the** screen was **a** simple **but** clever **system** **that** could **help** students **understand** difficult concepts **by** breaking **them** **down** **into** smaller pieces.

"**This** **is** **great**!" Alex said. "**This** **is** exactly **the** **kind** of **thing** **I** want **to** **create**. **But** **I** **can't** **do** **it** alone. **Would** **you** want **to** **work** **together** **on** **this**?"

Sarah didn't even **need** **to** **think** **about** **it**. "**Yes**! **I've** been hoping **to** **find** someone **who** really understood **this**. **When** **do** **we** **start**?"

"**Well**, **I** **just** left **my** **job**. **So** **I** guess **we** **can** **start** **right** **now**."

**They** both laughed. **It** felt **good** **to** **finally** **find** someone **who** saw **the** **world** **the** **same** way.

"**There's** **just** **one** **problem**," Sarah said **after** **a** while. "**We'll** **need** **money** **to** build **this**. **Do** **you** **have** any ideas **about** **that**?"

Alex had been thinking **about** **this** **question** **too**. "**Maybe**. **I** **know** **a** **guy** **who** invests in **new** companies. **His** **name** **is** David Thompson. **He** spoke at **my** **university** **a** few **years** ago. **I** could **try** **to** **reach** him."

"**Then** **let's** **do** **that**," Sarah said. "**But** **first**, **let's** **create** something **we** **can** **show** him. Something **that** proves **this** **can** **work**."

### Part 3: Building the Prototype

**For** **the** **next** **three** weeks, Alex **and** Sarah worked every **day** **and** most nights. **They** met at Sarah's **small** apartment **or** at coffee shops **around** **the** **city**. Alex would **bring** his laptop, **and** **they** would **sit** **together** coding, testing, **and** talking **about** **how** **to** **make** **their** idea **better**.

"**What** **do** **you** **think** **about** **this**?" Sarah asked **one** night, **showing** him **a** **new** **part** of **the** **program**.

Alex looked at **it** carefully. "**I** **like** **it**, **but** **I** **think** **we** **should** **change** **this** **part** here. **Maybe** **if** **we** **add** **a** way **for** **teachers** **to** **see** **how** **their** students **are** doing..."

"Oh, **that's** **good**! **Yes**, **let's** **do** **that**."

**It** wasn't **easy** **work**. **There** were **many** times **when** **they** couldn't **get** something **to** **work** **right**, **and** **they** would **have** **to** **start** **over**. **But** every **time** **they** solved **a** **problem**, **it** felt **like** **a** **small** victory.

Alex's **mother** called him **one** night while **he** was working. "Alex, **are** **you** okay? **You** **haven't** been **home** **much**. **Your** father **and** **I** **are** worried."

"**I'm** fine, Mom. **I'm** **just** working **on** something **important**."

"**But** what **about** **money**? **How** **will** **you** **pay** **for** **everything** **without** **a** **job**?"

"**I** **have** **some** savings. **And** **I'm** going **to** **try** **to** **find** **an** investor. Don't worry. **I** **know** what **I'm** doing."

**He** hoped **that** was **true**. **The** truth was, **he** didn't **know** **if** **this** would **work**. **But** **he** had **to** **try**.

**After** **three** weeks, **they** had something **to** **show**. **It** wasn't perfect, **but** **it** was **enough** **to** demonstrate **their** idea. **The** **program** could **help** **a** student **learn** **about** **any** subject **by** breaking **it** **down** **and** **providing** instant feedback. **It** could also **help** teachers **understand** **where** students were having **trouble**.

"**This** **is** **it**," Alex said, looking at **the** screen. "**This** **is** what **we'll** **show** David."

Sarah smiled. "**Then** **let's** **call** him."

### Part 4: The Pitch

Getting **a** meeting with David Thompson wasn't **easy**. Alex had **to** **send** **several** emails, **and** **it** took **two** weeks before **he** received **a** response. **But** finally, David agreed **to** **meet** **them** at **his** office downtown.

Alex **and** Sarah arrived early **that** **morning**. **They** were both nervous. **This** meeting could **decide** everything.

David's office was **on** **the** tenth floor of **a** **large** building. **When** **they** walked in, **they** saw **a** **man** in **his** fifties sitting behind **a** **big** desk. **He** stood **up** **and** shook **their** hands.

"**Thank** **you** **for** meeting **with** **us**," Alex said.

"**Well**, **I** remember **you** **from** **that** **event** at **the** **university**," David said. "**You** asked **good** questions **back** **then**. **So** **tell** **me**, what **do** **you** **have** **for** **me** **today**?"

Alex **and** Sarah spent **the** **next** thirty minutes explaining **their** idea. **They** showed him **the** prototype **and** explained **how** **it** could **be** used in schools **and** universities **around** **the** **country**—**or** even **the** **world**.

David listened carefully, asking questions **and** writing **down** notes. **When** **they** were finished, **he** sat **back** in **his** chair.

"**I** **have** **to** **say**, **this** **is** interesting. **But** **I** **have** **some** concerns. **First**, **the** education **market** **is** very difficult. **Many** companies **have** tried **to** **change** **it** **and** failed. **Second**, **you** **two** **don't** **have** **much** **business** experience. **Why** **should** **I** believe **you** **can** **make** **this** **work**?"

Alex felt his **heart** sink. **But** **then** **he** thought **about** **why** **he** was doing **this** in **the** **first** **place**.

"**You're** **right**," Alex said. "**We** **don't** **have** **all** **the** answers **yet**. **But** **we** **do** **have** something **important**: **we** **really** **care** **about** **this** **problem**. **I** **left** **a** **good** **job** **because** **I** believe education **needs** **to** **change**. Sarah has been working **on** **this** **for** **years** **because** **she** believes **it** **too**. **We're** **not** doing **this** **for** **money**. **We're** doing **it** **because** **it** matters."

Sarah added, "**And** **we're** willing **to** **learn** everything **we** **need** **to** **know**. **We'll** **listen** **to** advice. **We'll** **work** harder **than** **anyone**. **We** **just** **need** **a** chance **to** prove **it** **can** **be** done."

David was quiet **for** **what** felt **like** forever. **Then** **he** smiled.

"**You** **know** what? **I** **like** **that**. **I** **like** people **who** **are** willing **to** take risks **for** something **they** believe in. **I'll** **tell** **you** what. **I'll** give **you** seed funding—**enough** **to** **work** **on** **this** **full-time** **for** six months. **But** **in** **return**, **I** want **to** **be** **part** of **this**. **I'll** **help** **you** learn **the** **business** side. **I'll** open doors **for** **you**. **But** **you** have **to** **show** **me** **real** progress. **Do** **we** **have** **a** deal?"

Alex **and** Sarah looked at each **other**. **They** couldn't believe **it**. **This** was really happening.

"**Yes**," **they** both said at **the** **same** **time**.

### Part 5: New Beginnings

**That** night, Alex **and** Sarah went **out** **to** celebrate. **They** found **a** quiet restaurant **where** **they** could **talk** **without** **too** **much** noise.

"**I** **can't** believe **it**," Sarah said, still smiling. "**We** **actually** did **it**. **We** **have** **a** **real** investor. **This** **is** **the** beginning of something **big**."

Alex nodded. "**But** **it's** also **the** beginning of **a** **lot** of **hard** **work**. **We** **have** six months **to** prove **this** **can** **really** **work**. **We'll** **have** **to** hire **more** **people**, build **a** **better** **product**, **and** **find** **our** **first** customers."

"**I** **know**. **But** **we** **can** **do** **it**. **I** **know** **we** **can**."

**They** talked **until** **late** **that** night **about** **all** **their** plans. **They** would **need** **to** **find** **an** office space, hire developers **and** designers, **and** **decide** **on** **a** clear vision **for** **the** **company**. **There** was **so** **much** **to** **do**.

"What **should** **we** **call** **the** **company**?" Sarah asked. "**We** **need** **a** **name**."

Alex thought **about** **it**. "**I** **think** **we** **should** **call** **it** New Horizon. **Because** **that's** what **we're** trying **to** create **for** students—**a** **new** horizon, **a** **new** way **to** see **the** **world** **and** **learn** **about** **it**."

"New Horizon," Sarah repeated. "**I** **love** **it**."

**As** **they** left **the** restaurant **and** walked **back** **through** **the** city streets, Alex felt different **than** **he** had in **years**. **For** **the** **first** **time** in **a** **long** **time**, **he** felt **like** **he** was doing something **that** **really** mattered. **He** **was** scared, **sure**. **There** was **so** **much** **that** could **go** **wrong**. **But** **he** was also excited **and** hopeful **and** **full** of energy.

**He** thought **about** what his boss had said **when** **he** left: "**If** **that's** what **you** **need** **to** **do**, **then** **I** wish **you** **all** **the** **best**."

**Well**, **this** was what **he** needed **to** **do**. **And** **with** Sarah **and** David **by** **his** side, maybe—**just** maybe—**they** could **actually** **make** **it** happen.

**The** **next** **morning**, Alex woke **up** early. **He** made coffee **and** sat **at** **his** kitchen **table**, thinking **about** everything **that** had happened. **Just** **a** few weeks ago, **he** was sitting in **an** office feeling stuck. **Now** **he** was **the** co-founder of **a** **new** **company** with **real** support **and** **real** possibilities.

**His** **phone** rang. **It** was Sarah.

"Hey, **are** **you** up? **I** **couldn't** sleep. **I** kept thinking **about** **all** **the** things **we** **need** **to** **do**."

Alex laughed. "**Me** **too**. **Let's** **meet** **and** **start** working **on** **a** plan."

"**I'll** **be** **there** in thirty minutes."

**As** Alex waited **for** Sarah, **he** looked **out** **the** window. **The** sun was coming up, **and** **the** city was waking up. Somewhere **out** **there** were thousands of students **who** needed **better** ways **to** **learn**. Teachers **who** needed **better** tools. Schools **that** needed **real** **change**.

**And** now, **he** **and** Sarah had **a** chance **to** **help** **them**. **It** was **a** **big** **responsibility**. **But** **it** was also **a** **great** opportunity.

**This** was **just** **the** beginning.

### 第一部分：最后一天

那是春天的第一天，Alex Chen坐在办公桌前看着时钟。五年了——这是他在TechCorp工作的时间，这是全国最成功的软件公司之一。他本应该感到开心。他赚着不错的钱，住在漂亮的房子里，他的家人认为他在世界上有最好的工作。

但有什么地方不对劲。

"你看起来像是想去别的地方，"他的同事Jake端着一杯咖啡走过时说道。

"也许我确实想，"Alex回答，从电脑屏幕上转过身来。

他不知道为什么，但几个月来，每一天都感觉一样。他会来办公室，编写似乎没人真正需要的代码，然后回家。生活一定不止如此。

"如果你可以做任何事情，你会做什么？"Jake问道，靠在桌子上。

Alex想了一会儿。"我想我会创造一些真正帮助人们学习的东西。一些不同的东西。你知道，教育仍然停留在过去。我们有所有这些技术，但学校和学生并没有很好地利用它。"

Jake笑了。"那是一个很大的问题要解决。但是嘿，如果有人能做到，也许就是你。"

在Jake走开后，Alex坐在那里思考。为什么不呢？为什么不尝试创造一些真正能改变人们生活的东西？是的，这会很难。是的，他可能会失去现在拥有的安全感。但如果他不尝试呢？如果他在这里再呆十年，做同样的事情，然后带着遗憾回顾呢？

那天下午，Alex做出了一个决定。他走进老板的办公室。

"我需要和你谈一些重要的事情，"Alex说。

他的老板从电脑前抬起头。"当然，坐下。怎么了？"

"我要离开TechCorp。我想创办自己的公司。"

沉默了很长时间。然后他的老板开口了。"你知道，我们认为你是我们这里最优秀的人才之一。我们可以给你更高的职位，更多的钱......"

"这不是钱的问题，"Alex说。"这是关于做我真正相信的事情。"

他的老板慢慢点头。"我理解。我曾经也有过那种感觉。好吧，如果这是你需要做的，那么我祝你一切顺利。你想什么时候离开？"

"两周。我会确保在离开之前完成所有事情。"

当Alex走出办公室时，他既害怕又兴奋。他刚刚在五分钟内改变了他的整个生活。

### 第二部分：咖啡店会面

三天后，Alex坐在市中心的一家咖啡店里，等待一个他在网上认识的人。她的名字叫Sarah Martinez，她一直在写关于在教育中使用技术的新方法。从Alex所知，她和他有同样的想法。

"你是Alex吗？"一个年轻女子走到他的桌子旁问道。

"是的！你一定是Sarah。谢谢你来见我。"

他们坐下来，Sarah立即开始说话。"所以我读了你的邮件。你说你想建立一种新型的教育系统。告诉我更多关于这个的信息。"

在接下来的一个小时里，他们谈论了一切。Alex解释了他如何认为学生应该能够按照自己的节奏学习，教师需要更好的工具，以及技术可以帮助但只有在做对的情况下。

Sarah一直在点头。"是的！这正是我一直在说的！我一直在为此研究一些想法。我实际上建立了一个小程序，可能会展示我们正在谈论的内容。"

她拿出笔记本电脑给他看。屏幕上是一个简单但巧妙的系统，可以通过将复杂概念分解成更小的部分来帮助学生理解。

"这太好了！"Alex说。"这正是我想创造的那种东西。但我不能独自完成。你想和我一起做这个吗？"

Sarah甚至不需要考虑。"是的！我一直希望找到一个真正理解这一点的人。我们什么时候开始？"

"嗯，我刚离开了我的工作。所以我想我们现在就可以开始。"

他们都笑了。终于找到一个以同样方式看世界的人感觉很好。

"只有一个问题，"Sarah过了一会儿说。"我们需要钱来建立这个。你对此有什么想法吗？"

Alex也一直在思考这个问题。"也许。我认识一个投资新公司的人。他的名字叫David Thompson。几年前他在我的大学演讲。我可以试着联系他。"

"那我们就这样做，"Sarah说。"但首先，让我们创造一些我们可以向他展示的东西。证明这可以工作的东西。"

### 第三部分：构建原型

在接下来的三周里，Alex和Sarah每天工作，大部分晚上也在工作。他们在Sarah的小公寓或城市周围的咖啡店见面。Alex会带着他的笔记本电脑，他们会一起坐着编码、测试，并谈论如何让他们的想法更好。

"你觉得这个怎么样？"一天晚上Sarah问道，给他看程序的一个新部分。

Alex仔细看了看。"我喜欢它，但我认为我们应该改变这里的这一部分。也许如果我们添加一种方法让教师看到他们的学生表现如何......"

"哦，那很好！是的，让我们这样做。"

这不是容易的工作。有很多次他们无法让某些东西正常工作，他们不得不重新开始。但每次他们解决一个问题，都感觉像是一个小胜利。

一天晚上，当他在工作时，Alex的母亲打电话给他。"Alex，你还好吗？你最近不常回家。你父亲和我很担心。"

"我很好，妈妈。我只是在做一些重要的事情。"

"但是钱呢？没有工作你怎么支付一切？"

"我有一些积蓄。而且我要尝试找到一个投资者。别担心。我知道我在做什么。"

他希望这是真的。事实是，他不知道这是否会奏效。但他必须尝试。

三周后，他们有东西可以展示了。它并不完美，但足以演示他们的想法。该程序可以通过分解并提供即时反馈来帮助学生学习任何科目。它还可以帮助教师了解学生在哪里遇到困难。

"就是这个，"Alex看着屏幕说。"这就是我们要向David展示的。"

Sarah微笑着。"那我们就给他打电话吧。"

### 第四部分：推介

与David Thompson会面并不容易。Alex不得不发送几封电子邮件，花了两周时间才收到回复。但最终，David同意在他市中心的办公室与他们见面。

Alex和Sarah那天早上很早就到了。他们都很紧张。这次会面可以决定一切。

David的办公室在一栋大楼的十楼。当他们走进去时，他们看到一个五十多岁的男人坐在一张大桌子后面。他站起来和他们握手。

"谢谢你们与我们见面，"Alex说。

"嗯，我记得你在大学那次活动上的样子，"David说。"那时你问了很好的问题。所以告诉我，你们今天为我准备了什么？"

Alex和Sarah花了接下来的三十分钟解释他们的想法。他们向他展示了原型，并解释了它如何可以在全国各地的学校和大学使用——甚至全世界。

David仔细听着，提出问题并记下笔记。当他们结束时，他靠在椅子上。

"我不得不说，这很有趣。但我有一些担忧。首先，教育市场非常困难。许多公司试图改变它但失败了。其次，你们两个没有太多商业经验。为什么我应该相信你们能做到这一点？"

Alex感到心一沉。但随后他想起了他为什么要这样做。

"你说得对，"Alex说。"我们还没有所有的答案。但我们确实有重要的东西：我们真的关心这个问题。我离开了一份好工作，因为我相信教育需要改变。Sarah多年来一直在研究这个，因为她也相信。我们这样做不是为了钱。我们这样做是因为它很重要。"

Sarah补充说，"而且我们愿意学习我们需要知道的一切。我们会听取建议。我们会比任何人都更努力。我们只需要一个机会来证明它可以做到。"

David沉默了很久。然后他微笑了。

"你知道吗？我喜欢这个。我喜欢愿意为他们相信的事情冒险的人。我告诉你们。我会给你们种子资金——足够你们全职工作六个月。但作为回报，我想成为其中的一部分。我会帮助你们学习商业方面。我会为你们打开大门。但你们必须向我展示真正的进展。我们有协议吗？"

Alex和Sarah互相看了看。他们简直不敢相信。这真的在发生。

"是的，"他们同时说道。

### 第五部分：新的开始

那天晚上，Alex和Sarah出去庆祝。他们找到了一家安静的餐厅，在那里他们可以在没有太多噪音的情况下交谈。

"我简直不敢相信，"Sarah仍然微笑着说。"我们真的做到了。我们有一个真正的投资者。这是大事的开始。"

Alex点头。"但这也是大量艰苦工作的开始。我们有六个月的时间来证明这真的可行。我们必须雇佣更多的人，建立更好的产品，并找到我们的第一批客户。"

"我知道。但我们可以做到。我知道我们可以。"

他们一直聊到深夜，谈论他们所有的计划。他们需要找到一个办公空间，雇佣开发人员和设计师，并确定公司的清晰愿景。有太多事情要做。

"我们应该给公司取什么名字？"Sarah问道。"我们需要一个名字。"

Alex想了想。"我认为我们应该叫它New Horizon（新天际）。因为这就是我们试图为学生创造的——一个新的天际，一种看待世界和学习的新方式。"

"New Horizon，"Sarah重复道。"我喜欢它。"

当他们离开餐厅，走过城市街道时，Alex感觉与多年来不同。很长一段时间以来第一次，他觉得自己在做一些真正重要的事情。他当然害怕。有太多事情可能出错。但他也很兴奋、充满希望和精力充沛。

他想起了他离开时老板说的话："如果这是你需要做的，那么我祝你一切顺利。"

好吧，这就是他需要做的。有Sarah和David在他身边，也许——只是也许——他们真的可以实现它。

第二天早上，Alex很早就醒了。他泡了咖啡，坐在厨房的桌子旁，思考所发生的一切。就在几周前，他还坐在办公室里感觉被困住了。现在他是一家新公司的联合创始人，有真正的支持和真正的可能性。

他的电话响了。是Sarah。

"嘿，你起来了吗？我睡不着。我一直在想我们需要做的所有事情。"

Alex笑了。"我也是。让我们见面，开始制定计划。"

"我三十分钟后到。"

当Alex等待Sarah时，他望向窗外。太阳正在升起，城市正在醒来。在某个地方，有成千上万的学生需要更好的学习方式。需要更好工具的教师。需要真正改变的学校。

现在，他和Sarah有机会帮助他们。这是一个很大的责任。但这也是一个很好的机会。

这只是开始。
