## Reading Passage

### Part 1: Unexpected Demand

The **Monday** morning after the **launch**, Alex **arrived** at the office to **find** Emily **already** **there**, looking at her **email** with an **expression** he couldn't quite **read**.

"We have a **problem**," she said, **turning** her **screen** **towards** him.

Alex felt his **stomach** **drop**. "What kind of **problem**?"

"The **good** kind, **actually**. Five schools **contacted** us over the **weekend**. They all want to **participate** in our **program**. **But**..." she **paused**, "we promised Dr. Chen we'd **focus** on Riverside this **semester**. We don't have the **capacity** to **handle** **multiple** schools **simultaneously**."

Sarah **walked** in, followed by Jake, who looked like he'd **barely** **slept**. Emily **explained** the **situation**.

"That's **lots** of **demand**," Jake said, **obviously** **excited**. "That **means** our product **really** **works**!"

"**It** also **means** we need to make a **choice**," Sarah said **slowly**. "**Do** we **extend** our **operation** to **serve** more schools, or **stay** **focused** on **delivering** **quality** to **Riverside**?"

This was a **familiar** **debate**. **Throughout** their **launch** **preparation**, they'd **struggled** with **similar** **trade-offs**: **depth** versus **breadth**, **quality** versus **quantity**, **slow** **growth** versus **rapid** **expansion**.

Alex **thought** **carefully**. "Let's talk to Dr. Chen. See what she **thinks**."

That **afternoon**, they **met** with Dr. Chen at her **classroom**. She **listened** to their **explanation** of the **growing** **demand**.

"**Here's** my **advice**," she said **after** a **moment**. "Don't **expand** until you're **confident** you can **maintain** **quality**. I've **seen** too many **companies** **attempt** to **grow** **quickly** and **destroy** what made them **special** in the **first** **place**. Your **unique** **strength** is your **willingness** to **listen** and **adapt**. Don't **lose** that by **spreading** yourselves **too** **thin**."

"**But** what **if** we **lose** these **opportunities**?" Emily asked.

"**Then** you'll **find** **others**. **Trust** me—if your product **truly** **works**, the **demand** will still be **there** next **semester**. **Right** now, **focus** on making sure it **absolutely** **works** at Riverside. **Prove** your **approach** can **succeed** **thoroughly** before you **scale**."

The team **decided** to follow her **wisdom**. They would **politely** **decline** the new schools for now, **explaining** their **commitment** to **doing** things **properly**. Most **understood**. A few were **disappointed**, **but** **respected** the **honest** **approach**.

### Part 2: The Hiring Challenge

**Despite** their **decision** to **limit** **expansion**, they **obviously** needed **help**. The **ongoing** **support** for Riverside's **growing** **user** **base** required more **staff**. In **February**, they **began** **hiring**.

Finding the **right** people proved **incredibly** **difficult**. They **interviewed** **dozens** of **candidates**, **but** most didn't **fit** the **unique** **culture** they'd **built**.

"This one's **resume** is **impressive**," Emily said, **reviewing** an **application**. "Ten years' **experience**, worked at **multiple** **famous** **companies**..."

"**But** did you **read** his **answers** about **education**?" Sarah **interrupted**. "He doesn't **actually** **care** about schools or teachers. He **just** wants another **job**."

They needed people who **combined** **technical** **ability** with **genuine** **passion** for their **mission**. **Eventually**, they **found** two **candidates** who **seemed** **appropriate**:

**Dr. Rachel Wong** was a **former** **teacher** who'd **become** a **software** **engineer** **specifically** **because** she wanted to **improve** **education**. She was **quiet**, **thoughtful**, and **deeply** **aware** of **classroom** **realities**.

**Marcus Thompson** was a **young** **designer** with **slightly** **wild** ideas about **user** **interfaces**. He was **enthusiastic**, **creative**, and **willing** to **defend** his **vision** **passionately**—sometimes **too** **passionately**.

"I **like** Rachel," Alex said after their **interviews**. "She **obviously** **understands** teachers."

"I'm **worried** about Marcus," Sarah **admitted**. "He's **talented**, **but** he **seems** **possibly** **difficult** to **manage**."

Jake **disagreed**. "I **think** his **energy** is exactly what we **need**. Plus, his **portfolio** is **truly** **impressive**."

They **hired** both, **slightly** **nervous** about how the **expanded** team would **change** their **dynamic**.

### Part 3: Office Space Crisis

With seven people **attempting** to **work** in their **tiny** office, the **space** **problem** **became** **impossible** to **ignore**. The **single** **bathroom**, **limited** **desks**, and **absence** of **proper** **meeting** **areas** created **daily** **frustration**.

"We need a **proper** **facility**," Emily **insisted** during a **particularly** **uncomfortable** **Wednesday** afternoon. "This is **directly** **affecting** our **ability** to **operate** **effectively**."

They **toured** several **potential** **spaces**. Most were **far** **above** their **budget**. **Finally**, they **found** an **option**: an old **warehouse** in an **industrial** **district**, **slightly** **outside** **downtown**.

"It needs **lots** of **work**," the **owner** **explained**. "The **heating** isn't **fully** **functional**, there's some **damage** from a **storm** last **winter**, and you'll need to **construct** **walls** to **create** **separate** **areas**. **But** the **price** is **reasonable**, and there's **plenty** of **space**."

Alex did the **mental** **math**. The **rent** was **affordable**, **but** the **construction** **costs** would **demand** a **significant** **portion** of their **remaining** **cash**. It was **basically** a **choice** **between** **comfort** now or **revenue** **growth** **later**.

"Let's do it," he **decided**. "We can't **grow** **stuck** in this **tiny** **space**."

The **construction** took **three** **weeks**. **During** that **period**, the team **worked** from **coffee** **shops**, **libraries**, and **sometimes** Rachel's **living** **room**. It was **chaotic**, **but** **somehow** they **managed**.

When they **finally** **moved** into the new **facility** in early **March**, everyone felt **huge** **relief**. They now had **proper** **desks**, **multiple** **meeting** **rooms**, and **even** a **tiny** **kitchen** **area**. Marcus **immediately** **started** **decorating** the **walls** with **colorful** **paintings** and **design** **posters**.

"This **feels** like a **real** **company** now," Jake said, **obviously** **proud**.

**But** the **expansion** brought **unexpected** **consequences**.

### Part 4: Cultural Shifts

With the **bigger** **space** and **additional** **staff**, the **informal** **culture** that had **defined** New Horizon **began** to **change**. **Previously**, **everyone** knew **everything** about the **product** and **decisions**. Now, **communication** **required** more **formal** **structure**.

Rachel, **despite** her **quiet** **nature**, **quickly** **emerged** as a **valuable** **voice** for **teachers' **perspectives**. **During** **meetings**, she would **gently** **correct** **assumptions** or **recommend** **changes** **based** on **classroom** **reality**.

"We're **designing** this **feature** **assuming** teachers have **unlimited** **internet** **access**," she **observed** during one **session**. "**But** **multiple** schools I worked at had **terrible** **connectivity**. We need an **offline** **mode**."

Marcus, **however**, created **tension**. He had **strong** **opinions** about **design** and wasn't **afraid** to **challenge** **others**—**including** Sarah's **technical** **decisions**.

"This **interface** is **too** **complicated**," he **insisted** one **Friday** **afternoon**, **pointing** at Sarah's **latest** **feature**. "**Nobody** will **understand** **how** to **use** **this**."

Sarah's **reaction** was **sharp**. "**Maybe** if you **understood** the **technical** **constraints**, you'd **realize** why it's **designed** this **way**."

"**Maybe** if you **understood** **users**, you'd **realize** they don't **care** about **technical** **constraints**," Marcus **shot** **back**.

Alex **had** to **intervene** **multiple** **times**. The **familiar** **dynamic** where **everyone** **worked** **smoothly** **together** was **slowly** **disappearing**.

Emily **noticed** the **problem** **too**. "We need to **establish** **clearer** **processes**," she told Alex **privately**. "When we were **tiny**, we could **operate** informally. **But** with **seven** people, we need **structure** or we'll **descend** into **chaos**."

They **introduced** **weekly** **team** **meetings**, **formal** **project** **reviews**, and **clear** **decision**-making **processes**. It **helped**, **but** something **felt** **lost**—the **spontaneous**, **excited** **energy** of the **early** **days**.

### Part 5: The Quality Crisis

The **real** **emergency** **emerged** in mid-**March**. Mrs. Patterson **contacted** them, her **email** **marked** "**URGENT**."

"The **system** **crashed** **today** **during** **class**," she **wrote**. "I **lost** **three** **hours** of **grading** **work**. **Several** students' **progress** **data** **disappeared**. I **depend** on this **tool** now, and I **can't** **afford** these kinds of **failures**."

The team **investigated** **immediately**. Jake **discovered** the **problem**: his **original** **code**, **designed** for **speed** when **handling** a **single** **class**, **couldn't** **properly** **manage** the **load** when **dozens** of teachers **used** it **simultaneously**.

"I **fucked** up," he **admitted**, looking **exhausted**. "I **optimized** for **quick** **development**, not **scalability**. Now we're **paying** the **consequence**."

Sarah **examined** the **code**. "This is **going** to **require** a **fundamental** **rebuild** of the **database** **architecture**. We're **talking** **weeks** of **work**, **minimum**."

"We don't **have** **weeks**," Emily said, her **voice** **tight**. "We have **angry** teachers **right** now who **trusted** us. If we **fail** to **fix** this **quickly**, we'll **lose** their **confidence** and probably our **partnership** with Riverside."

The **atmosphere** **turned** **tense**. This was their **first** **major** **crisis** **since** the **successful** **launch**.

Alex **gathered** **everyone**. "**Here's** what we're **going** to do. Jake and Sarah, you **focus** **entirely** on **fixing** the **core** **problem**. Rachel, you **handle** **communication** with the teachers—**explain** what **happened**, **apologize** **sincerely**, and **keep** them **updated** on our **progress**. Emily and I will **manage** **everything** **else** and **ensure** you **both** have **whatever** you **need**. Marcus, **pause** any new **design** **work** and **focus** on **helping** **wherever** possible."

For the **next** **two** **weeks**, the team **worked** **almost** **continuously**. Jake and Sarah **barely** **slept**, **rebuilding** the **database** **architecture** while **attempting** to **maintain** **service**. Rachel **spent** **hours** **talking** to **frustrated** teachers, **carefully** **rebuilding** **trust**.

Dr. Chen proved **invaluable** **again**. **Despite** the **problems**, she **defended** New Horizon to her **staff**, **reminding** them that **every** **software** has **issues** and what **mattered** was how **companies** **responded** to **problems**.

### Part 6: Marcus's Surprise Contribution

During the **crisis**, **something** **unexpected** **happened**. Marcus, **despite** his **sometimes** **abrasive** **style**, **revealed** an **impressive** **work** **ethic**. He **stayed** **late**, **carefully** **documenting** **every** **bug** and **issue**, **creating** **detailed** **guides** for teachers about **temporary** **workarounds**, and **even** **making** **apologetic** **videos** **explaining** the **situation**.

"I **never** **thought** I'd **see** Marcus **being** **humble**," Jake **commented** one **night**, watching Marcus **carefully** **prepare** another **update** **message**.

Marcus **overheard**. "Look, I can be **difficult** about **design** **because** I **care** about **excellence**. **But** when **users** are **suffering** **because** of **our** **mistakes**, that's **different**. That **demands** **immediate**, **humble** **service**."

His **attitude** **impressed** **everyone**. Sarah, who'd **been** most **skeptical** about him, **began** to **appreciate** his **passion**.

"I **misjudged** you," she told him **directly**. "You're not **difficult**—you're **demanding**. There's a **difference**."

Marcus **smiled**, **slightly** **embarrassed**. "I should be less **confrontational** in **meetings**, **though**. I **realize** my **style** **creates** **unnecessary** **tension**."

**Through** the **crisis**, the **expanded** team **began** to **genuinely** **bond**. Rachel's **calm**, **thoughtful** **approach** **balanced** Marcus's **passionate** **intensity**. **Together**, they **represented** a **broader** **range** of **perspectives** than the **original** **four**.

### Part 7: Lessons in Growth

**Finally**, after **intense** **effort**, they **deployed** the **fixed** **system**. It **performed** **significantly** **better**, **handling** **multiple** **concurrent** **users** **without** **issues**. Teachers **gradually** **regained** **confidence**.

One **Tuesday** **evening**, **after** **confirming** the **fix** was **stable**, the **exhausted** team **gathered** in their new **space**.

David **visited**, having **heard** about the **crisis**. "**Tell** me what you **learned**," he said **simply**.

Alex **thought** **carefully**. "We **learned** that **success** **creates** its **own** **challenges**. **Growth** **demands** **different** **processes**, **different** **skills**, **different** **thinking**. What **worked** for a **tiny** team **doesn't** **automatically** **scale**."

Sarah **added**, "We also **learned** we need to **balance** **speed** with **quality** **differently**. Moving **fast** is **valuable**, **but** not if it **creates** **fundamental** **problems** **later**."

Emily **spoke** up. "I **learned** that **hiring** is **incredibly** **important**. Rachel and Marcus **brought** **different** **perspectives** that made us **stronger**, **even** when it was **uncomfortable**."

Jake **was** **quiet**, then **finally** **spoke**. "I **learned** I need to think about **scalability** from the **beginning**, not **just** **immediate** **functionality**. My **shortcuts** **almost** **destroyed** **everything** we **built**."

David **nodded**. "**Those** are **valuable** **lessons**. **Here's** **mine**: **every** **company** goes **through** **growing** **pains**. The **question** isn't **whether** you'll **face** **challenges**, **but** how you'll **respond** to them. You **responded** **well**—you **admitted** **mistakes**, **worked** **intensely** to **fix** them, and **communicated** **honestly** with **users**. That's what **separates** **companies** that **survive** **growth** from **those** that **collapse**."

He **paused**. "**But** there's **something** **else** you should **know**. Other **companies** are **starting** to **notice** your **success**. **Competition** is **coming**. Your **growing** **pains** **phase** is just the **beginning**. The **next** **challenge** will be **defending** your **position** in the **market**."

The team **exchanged** **nervous** **glances**. They'd **been** so **focused** on **internal** **challenges** that they **hadn't** **considered** **external** **threats**.

**As** David **left**, Alex looked **around** at his **expanded** team. They were **tired**, **slightly** **bruised** from the **experience**, **but** **stronger** and more **capable** than **before**.

"**Tomorrow**," he said, "we **start** **preparing** for whatever **comes** **next**. **But** **tonight**, let's **appreciate** what we've **accomplished**. We **survived** **our** **first** **real** **growth** **crisis**. We're not a **tiny** **startup** **anymore**. We're **becoming** a **real** **company**."

They **ordered** **pizza**—a **tradition** now—and **spent** the **evening** **sharing** **stories** about the **intense** **two** **weeks**. The **laughter** **mixed** with **exhaustion** felt **earned**.

New Horizon had **grown**, and with **growth** came **pain**. **But** they'd **faced** it **together**, and that **made** **all** the **difference**.
