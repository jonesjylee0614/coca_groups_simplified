## Reading Passage

### Part 1: The Search for Space

The **morning** after David agreed to invest, Alex and Sarah met at a coffee **shop** to **develop** their **plan**. They had a **clear** **goal**: find office **space**, hire at **least** **three** people, and **develop** a working **version** of their **product** within six months.

"We need to find a **site**," Alex said, **looking** at his **list** of **available** **buildings**. "Something we can **afford** with our current funds."

Sarah pulled up several **options** on her **computer**. "**Here's** an interesting **option**. It's a **former** **store** in the **south** **part** of town. Not **pretty**, but the **price** is **right**."

They **visited** the **site** that afternoon. The **building** was old, with **walls** that needed **paint** and **windows** that didn't quite **close** **properly**. But it had enough **space** for **perhaps** eight people, and the **rent** was within their **budget**.

"It needs **work**," Sarah said, **looking** **around**.

"**Everything** needs **work** right now," Alex replied. "But I can **imagine** us **here**. **Can't** you? Over **there** could be the **development** **space**. **That** corner could be a **meeting** area. We could **fill** it with **energy** and make it feel like **home**."

Sarah smiled. "You're **right**. Let's take it."

They **signed** the papers that **evening**. New Horizon **finally** had a physical **home**.

### Part 2: The Interview Process

Finding the **right** people proved **significantly** more **difficult**. **Over** the **next** two weeks, Alex and Sarah conducted **nearly** twenty **interviews**. They were **looking** for **specific** **skills**: developers who understood education, designers who could **create** **simple** interfaces, and **somebody** who could **manage** **projects**.

Most candidates didn't **quite** **fit**. Some wanted too much **money**. Others didn't **share** their **passion** for education. A few seemed **perfect** on **paper** but **failed** to **realize** the **risks** of **joining** such a **young** **company**.

Then Jake Riley walked in.

Jake was twenty-two, **recently** graduated, wearing a t-shirt with code jokes on it. He carried a **laptop** covered in stickers and looked **nervous**.

"**Hi**," he said. "I'm **probably** not what you're **looking** for. I don't have much **experience**. But I **really** believe in what you're doing."

Sarah conducted the technical **interview**. She asked him to solve a coding **problem**. Jake's **approach** was unconventional, but he solved it **quickly** and **clearly** explained his thought **process**.

"Why do you want to **work** **here**?" Alex asked.

Jake's **voice** became more confident. "My little **sister** is in high school. She's **struggling** with math, and her teachers don't have time to **help** her **individually**. When I read about New Horizon, I thought—this could **actually** make a **difference**. I want to be **part** of that. I don't **care** about **salary** or **position**. I **just** want to build something that **matters**."

Alex and Sarah exchanged glances. **This** was **exactly** the **type** of person they needed.

"When can you **start**?" Sarah asked.

Jake's eyes went wide. "**Really**? **Seriously**? **Tomorrow**! I can **start** **tomorrow**!"

### Part 3: Emily's Arrival

Two days **later**, David called with a suggestion. "I know **somebody** who might **interest** you. Her **name** is Emily Park. She was a **product** **manager** at TechFlow for five **years**. She **recently** left to look for something more **meaningful**."

"Why would she **join** us?" Sarah asked. "We can't **pay** anywhere **near** what a big **company** **pays**."

"Let me **introduce** you. **Perhaps** she'll **surprise** you."

Emily **arrived** at their new office wearing **professional** clothes that made the run-down **building** seem even more shabby. She was twenty-eight, with a **serious** expression and a **portfolio** of **successful** **projects**.

"I'll be **clear**," Emily said, sitting down. "David told me about your **company**. **Your** **vision** is interesting, but you have **major** **problems**."

Alex felt **defensive**. "What **problems**?"

"You're **developing** **technology** without a clear **strategy** for **actually** **reaching** users. You **haven't** **identified** your **target** **market**. You have no **evidence** that schools will **actually** **adopt** your **product**. And from what David showed me, your user **interface** needs **significant** **improvement**."

Sarah's **face** went **red**. "We've been **working** on **this** for months—"

"And I **respect** that **effort**," Emily interrupted. "But **passion** isn't enough. You need **someone** who **understands** **product** **development**, user **experience**, and market **reality**. That's why I'm **here**. I **want** to **help** you **succeed**, not **fail** like **nearly** every education startup does."

There was **silence** in the **room**. Jake **looked** **nervous**. Alex didn't know **whether** to feel angry or grateful.

"Why would you **join** us?" Alex **finally** asked.

Emily's **serious** expression softened **slightly**. "**Because** I'm tired of building things that don't **matter**. TechFlow **products** made **millions** of **dollars** but changed **nothing** **important**. I **want** to work on something that could **actually** **affect** people's lives. But **only** **if** we do it **right**."

Alex **considered** this **carefully**. She was challenging them, but **maybe** that was **exactly** what they needed.

"**OK**," he said. "**If** you **join** us, what would be your **first** **step**?"

"User **research**," Emily replied without **hesitation**. "We need to **talk** to **actual** teachers and **students**. **Understand** their **real** **problems**. **Then** **develop** a **product** based on **evidence**, not **assumptions**."

Sarah still **looked** **unhappy**, but she nodded. "That makes **sense**."

"**Then** **let's** try this," Alex said. "**Join** us for a **trial** **period**. We'll **work** **together** and see **if** it **fits**."

Emily smiled for the **first** time. "**Deal**."

### Part 4: Team Tensions

The **following** weeks were **both** **exciting** and **difficult**. Jake **threw** **himself** into coding, often staying until late at **night**. He played **music** while he worked and brought **energy** to the **space**. But his code, while clever, sometimes **lacked** structure.

Emily **immediately** began organizing **everything**. She created **project** plans, **identified** **priorities**, and pushed for **clear** **goals**. But her **direct** **style** often **sounded** **critical**, **especially** to Sarah.

The **tension** **finally** **exploded** one afternoon. They were **discussing** the user **interface** **design**. Sarah had spent **hours** **developing** a **feature** that she thought was **particularly** clever.

"This doesn't make **sense**," Emily said, **looking** at the **design**. "Users won't **understand** **this** **immediately**. We need something **simpler**."

"It's not **difficult** **if** you **actually** **try** to **understand** it," Sarah **argued**. "The **problem** is that you don't **appreciate** technical **elegance**."

"Technical **elegance** **means** **nothing** **if** users can't **figure** out **how** to **use** it," Emily shot **back**. "I've **seen** **dozens** of **products** **fail** **because** engineers **focused** on **being** clever **instead** of **being** **clear**."

"**Maybe** the **problem** is **product** **managers** who don't **understand** **technology**!"

"**OK**, **stop**!" Alex **stepped** between them. "**Both** of you, **outside**. **Now**."

In the **hallway**, Alex took a **deep** **breath**. "**Look**, I **know** this is **difficult**. We're all under **pressure**. But we're **supposed** to be a **team**. We need to **figure** out **how** to **work** **together**, or **this** won't **succeed**."

Sarah crossed her **arms**. "She's **basically** **saying** my **work** is **terrible**."

"That's not what I'm **saying**," Emily protested. "I'm **trying** to **ensure** our **product** **actually** **works** for **real** people, not **just** **for** us."

"**Then** **maybe** **say** that **differently**," Alex suggested. "And Sarah, **maybe** we can **listen** to Emily's **experience** without taking it as **personal** **criticism**."

They **both** looked **unhappy**, but nodded.

"**Good**," Alex said. "**Now** **let's** **go** **back** inside and **work** on **this** **together**."

### Part 5: David's Lesson

**That** **evening**, Alex called David, **feeling** **worried**. "I don't know **if** I'm **ready** to **lead** a **team**. Sarah and Emily keep **fighting**. Jake is **great** but needs **guidance**. And I'm **supposed** to **manage** **all** this while **also** **developing** the **product**?"

David **laughed**. "Welcome to being a CEO. **Did** you **think** it would be **easy**?"

"I thought **if** we all **shared** the same **goal**, we'd **naturally** **work** well **together**."

"**That's** a **nice** **dream**," David said. "But **here's** the **reality**: **different** people **bring** **different** **perspectives**, and those **differences** will **cause** **conflict**. **Your** **job** isn't to **avoid** **conflict**—it's to **manage** it productively."

"How do I do that?"

"**First**, **recognize** that both Sarah and Emily **probably** have **valid** **points**. Sarah's technical **brilliance** is why you could **build** **this** in the **first** **place**. But Emily's user **focus** is why it **might** **actually** **succeed** in the **market**. **Second**, **create** **clear** **roles**. **Everybody** needs to know what **decisions** they own. **Third**, **protect** **team** **culture**. Don't **let** small **tensions** **grow** into **major** **divisions**."

Alex wrote this down. "Anything else?"

"**Yes**. **Remember** that **failure** is **part** of the **process**. You're going to **fail** at things—**everybody** does. What **matters** is **how** **quickly** you **learn** and **adapt**."

These **words** would prove **particularly** **important** **sooner** than Alex **expected**.

### Part 6: The First Test

After six weeks, they had something to **show**: a **beta** **version** of their **product**. It wasn't **perfect**, but Emily convinced them it was **ready** for **initial** **testing**.

"We need **real** **feedback**," she said. "I've **arranged** for us to **visit** Lincoln High School **tomorrow**. They've agreed to let us **test** our **product** with a **single** **class**."

**That** **morning**, the **entire** team—Alex, Sarah, Emily, and Jake—drove to the school. They **set** up their **laptops** and **prepared** their **demo**. The teacher, Ms. Rodriguez, brought in her **students**: twenty teenagers who **looked** **mostly** bored.

"**Alright**, **class**," Ms. Rodriguez said. "These **visitors** are going to **show** you a new learning **tool**. **Please** **pay** **attention**."

Alex began the **presentation**, explaining their **vision** of **personalized** learning. Emily **showed** **how** the **product** worked. Then they invited the **students** to **try** it **themselves**.

What **happened** next was **painful** to **watch**.

The **students** couldn't **figure** out **how** to **log** in. The **interface** confused them. One student **asked**, "Why would I **use** this **instead** of **just** **looking** up answers online?" Another said it was "kind of boring." Several **simply** **gave** up after a few minutes.

After thirty minutes, Ms. Rodriguez **pulled** them aside. "I **appreciate** what you're **trying** to do," she said gently. "But **this** isn't **ready**. The **students** don't see the **value**, and the **technology** is too complicated for **classroom** **use**."

The **ride** **back** to the office was **silent**. Jake **stared** out the **window**. Sarah **looked** **close** to **tears**. Emily's **face** was **impossible** to **read**. Alex felt like he'd been hit in the **stomach**.

### Part 7: Night of Truth

**Back** at the office, **nobody** knew what to **say**.

**Finally**, Sarah spoke, her **voice** **quiet**. "**Maybe** this was a **mistake**. **Maybe** we're not **ready** for this."

"**Or** **maybe** we **just** **need** to **improve** what we have," Emily said. "This is **normal** in **product** **development**. **First** **tests** **usually** **fail**."

"**Easy** for you to **say**," Sarah snapped. "You didn't **spend** months building **this**."

"No, but I've **spent** **years** **seeing** what **works** and what doesn't. And I can **tell** you that **this** **specific** **situation** is **fixable**."

Jake **suddenly** spoke up. "My **sister** tried it **last** week. She said the same things **those** **students** said **today**. I didn't want to **mention** it **because** I didn't want to **hurt** **anyone's** **feelings**. But **maybe** that was wrong. **Maybe** we need to be more **honest** with **each** **other**."

Alex **looked** at his **team**. They **all** **looked** **exhausted**, **disappointed**, and **worried**. But they were **still** **here**.

"**You're** **right**," Alex said. "**All** of you. Sarah, you're **right** that this is **hard** and that **failure** **hurts**. Emily, you're **right** that we can **learn** from **this**. And Jake, you're **absolutely** **right** that we need to be **honest**, even when it's **difficult**."

He stood up and walked to the **whiteboard**. "**So** **let's** **do** this **differently**. **Let's** make a **list** of **everything** that went **wrong** **today**. No **defending**, no **arguing**. **Just** **honest** **observations**. **Then** we **figure** out **how** to **fix** **each** **problem**."

For the next **three** **hours**, they worked **together**. Sarah **admitted** that she'd **focused** too much on technical **features** and not enough on **actual** usability. Emily **acknowledged** that she'd been too **critical** without offering enough **support**. Jake **shared** **detailed** **feedback** from his **sister** that he'd been too **nervous** to **mention** **before**.

**Slowly**, a new **picture** began to **emerge**. They needed to **completely** **redesign** the **interface**. They needed to **focus** on **one** **specific** **use** **case** **instead** of trying to **solve** **every** **problem**. And they needed to **actually** **involve** teachers and **students** in the **design** **process**, not **just** **test** with them at the **end**.

By **midnight**, they had a new **plan**. It meant **throwing** **away** some of their work and **starting** **over** on **certain** **parts**. But for the **first** time, they were **truly** working as a **team**, not **just** **individuals** with a **common** **goal**.

"**I** think we can do **this**," Sarah said, **looking** at the **board** covered in **notes**. "**If** we **really** **work** **together**, we can make something **that** **actually** **works**."

"**Agreed**," Emily said. "And I **promise** to **give** **more** **positive** **feedback** **along** with the **criticism**."

Jake **smiled**. "Can we **order** **pizza**? I **work** **better** with **food**."

**Everybody** **laughed**, and the **tension** that had been building for weeks **finally** broke.

Alex **looked** at his **team**—this **small** **group** of people who had **chosen** to **take** a **risk** on an uncertain **future**. They'd **faced** their **first** **real** **failure** **together**. And **instead** of **falling** **apart**, they'd **grown** **stronger**.

"**This** is **just** the **beginning**," he said. "We're going to **fail** **again**. **Probably** **many** times. But **if** we keep **learning** and keep **supporting** **each** **other**, we'll **eventually** **build** something **really** **special**."

"To **failure** and learning!" Jake raised his coffee cup.

"To **failure** and learning!" the others **echoed**.

As they **sat** **there** in their run-down office at **midnight**, eating **pizza** and **redesigning** their **product**, Alex **realized** something **important**: building a **company** wasn't **really** about the **product** or the **technology**. It was about the **people** and their **ability** to **work** **together** **through** **challenges**.

And **despite** all the **difficulties**, they had something **valuable**: a **team** that was willing to be **honest**, to **learn**, and to keep **trying**.

**That** was worth more than any **perfect** **product** could **ever** be.

## Chinese Translation - 中文翻译

### 第一部分：寻找空间

David同意投资后的第二天早上，Alex和Sarah在一家咖啡店见面制定计划。他们有一个明确的目标：找到办公空间，至少雇佣三个人，并在六个月内开发出产品的工作版本。

"我们需要找到一个地点，"Alex说，看着他的可用建筑列表。"我们目前的资金能负担得起的地方。"

Sarah在电脑上调出了几个选择。"这是一个有趣的选择。这是城南的一家前商店。不漂亮，但价格合适。"

那天下午他们参观了这个地点。建筑很旧，墙壁需要粉刷，窗户关不太紧。但它有足够的空间可以容纳大约八个人，租金在他们的预算之内。

"它需要改造，"Sarah环顾四周说。

"现在一切都需要努力，"Alex回答。"但我可以想象我们在这里。你不能吗？那边可以是开发空间。那个角落可以是会议区。我们可以用能量填满它，让它感觉像家一样。"

Sarah微笑了。"你说得对。我们要了。"

他们那天晚上签了文件。New Horizon终于有了一个实体的家。

### 第二部分：面试过程

找到合适的人被证明要困难得多。在接下来的两周里，Alex和Sarah进行了近二十次面试。他们在寻找特定的技能：了解教育的开发人员，能创建简单界面的设计师，以及能管理项目的人。

大多数候选人都不太合适。有些人要的钱太多。其他人不分享他们对教育的热情。少数人在纸面上看起来很完美，但未能意识到加入如此年轻的公司的风险。

然后Jake Riley走了进来。

Jake二十二岁，刚毕业，穿着一件印有代码笑话的T恤。他拿着一台贴满贴纸的笔记本电脑，看起来很紧张。

"嗨，"他说。"我可能不是你们要找的人。我没有太多经验。但我真的相信你们在做的事情。"

Sarah进行了技术面试。她要求他解决一个编码问题。Jake的方法很不传统，但他快速解决了问题，并清楚地解释了他的思考过程。

"你为什么想在这里工作？"Alex问。

Jake的声音变得更加自信。"我的妹妹在上高中。她在数学上很吃力，而她的老师没有时间单独帮助她。当我读到New Horizon时，我想——这真的可以产生影响。我想成为其中的一部分。我不在乎薪水或职位。我只想建造一些重要的东西。"

Alex和Sarah交换了眼神。这正是他们需要的那种人。

"你什么时候可以开始？"Sarah问。

Jake的眼睛睁大了。"真的吗？说真的？明天！我明天就可以开始！"

### 第三部分：Emily的到来

两天后，David打电话提出建议。"我认识一个可能让你们感兴趣的人。她的名字叫Emily Park。她在TechFlow做了五年产品经理。她最近离职寻找更有意义的东西。"

"她为什么要加入我们？"Sarah问。"我们付不起大公司那样的薪水。"

"让我介绍你们。也许她会让你们惊讶。"

Emily穿着职业装到达他们的新办公室，这让破旧的建筑显得更加寒酸。她二十八岁，表情严肃，有一份成功项目的作品集。

"我会很直接，"Emily坐下说。"David告诉了我你们公司的事。你们的愿景很有趣，但你们有重大问题。"

Alex感到防御。"什么问题？"

"你们在开发技术，却没有明确的策略来真正接触用户。你们还没有确定目标市场。你们没有证据表明学校会真正采用你们的产品。从David给我看的来看，你们的用户界面需要显著改进。"

Sarah的脸变红了。"我们已经为此工作了好几个月——"

"我尊重那种努力，"Emily打断道。"但热情是不够的。你们需要一个理解产品开发、用户体验和市场现实的人。这就是我来这里的原因。我想帮助你们成功，而不是像几乎每个教育创业公司一样失败。"

房间里一片寂静。Jake看起来很紧张。Alex不知道该感到生气还是感激。

"你为什么要加入我们？"Alex最后问道。

Emily严肃的表情稍微柔和了一些。"因为我厌倦了建造无关紧要的东西。TechFlow的产品赚了数百万美元，但没有改变任何重要的东西。我想做一些真正能影响人们生活的事情。但前提是我们做对。"

Alex仔细考虑了这个问题。她在挑战他们，但也许这正是他们需要的。

"好的，"他说。"如果你加入我们，你的第一步是什么？"

"用户研究，"Emily毫不犹豫地回答。"我们需要与真正的教师和学生交谈。了解他们真正的问题。然后基于证据而不是假设开发产品。"

Sarah仍然看起来不高兴，但她点了点头。"这有道理。"

"那我们试试这个，"Alex说。"加入我们试用期。我们一起工作，看看是否合适。"

Emily第一次微笑了。"成交。"

### 第四部分：团队紧张

接下来的几周既令人兴奋又困难。Jake全身心投入编码，经常工作到深夜。他工作时播放音乐，给空间带来了能量。但他的代码虽然聪明，有时缺乏结构。

Emily立即开始组织一切。她创建了项目计划，确定了优先事项，并推动明确的目标。但她直接的风格听起来经常很挑剔，特别是对Sarah。

紧张局势终于在一天下午爆发了。他们正在讨论用户界面设计。Sarah花了几个小时开发了一个她认为特别聪明的功能。

"这没有意义，"Emily看着设计说。"用户不会立即理解这个。我们需要更简单的东西。"

"如果你真的试图理解它，这并不难，"Sarah争论道。"问题是你不欣赏技术优雅。"

"如果用户无法弄清楚如何使用它，技术优雅就毫无意义，"Emily反击道。"我看过几十个产品失败，因为工程师专注于聪明而不是清晰。"

"也许问题是不理解技术的产品经理！"

"好了，停！"Alex站在她们中间。"你们两个，出去。现在。"

在走廊里，Alex深吸了一口气。"听着，我知道这很困难。我们都在压力之下。但我们应该是一个团队。我们需要弄清楚如何一起工作，否则这不会成功。"

Sarah抱着胳膊。"她基本上在说我的工作很糟糕。"

"我不是那个意思，"Emily抗议道。"我试图确保我们的产品真正为真实的人工作，而不仅仅是为我们。"

"那也许换个方式说，"Alex建议。"而Sarah，也许我们可以听取Emily的经验，而不把它当作个人批评。"

她们都看起来不高兴，但点了点头。

"好，"Alex说。"现在让我们回去，一起解决这个问题。"

### 第五部分：David的教训

那天晚上，Alex打电话给David，感到担忧。"我不知道我是否准备好领导一个团队。Sarah和Emily一直在争吵。Jake很棒但需要指导。而我应该管理所有这些，同时还要开发产品？"

David笑了。"欢迎成为CEO。你以为这会很容易吗？"

"我以为如果我们都有相同的目标，我们自然会合作得很好。"

"那是一个美好的梦想，"David说。"但现实是：不同的人带来不同的观点，这些差异会引起冲突。你的工作不是避免冲突——而是有效地管理它。"

"我怎么做到？"

"首先，认识到Sarah和Emily可能都有有效的观点。Sarah的技术才华是你能首先构建这个的原因。但Emily的用户关注是它可能真正在市场上成功的原因。第二，创建明确的角色。每个人都需要知道他们拥有什么决策权。第三，保护团队文化。不要让小的紧张发展成重大分裂。"

Alex把这些写下来。"还有别的吗？"

"是的。记住失败是过程的一部分。你会在事情上失败——每个人都会。重要的是你学习和适应的速度。"

这些话很快就会被证明特别重要。

### 第六部分：第一次测试

六周后，他们有东西可以展示了：他们产品的测试版。它不完美，但Emily说服他们已经准备好进行初步测试。

"我们需要真实的反馈，"她说。"我已经安排我们明天参观林肯高中。他们同意让我们在一个班级测试我们的产品。"

那天早上，整个团队——Alex、Sarah、Emily和Jake——开车去了学校。他们安装好笔记本电脑，准备演示。老师Rodriguez女士带来了她的学生：二十个看起来大多很无聊的青少年。

"好的，同学们，"Rodriguez女士说。"这些访客要向你们展示一个新的学习工具。请注意。"

Alex开始演讲，解释他们个性化学习的愿景。Emily展示了产品是如何工作的。然后他们邀请学生自己尝试。

接下来发生的事情看起来很痛苦。

学生们无法弄清楚如何登录。界面让他们困惑。一个学生问："我为什么要用这个而不是直接在网上查找答案？"另一个说这"有点无聊"。几个人在几分钟后就放弃了。

三十分钟后，Rodriguez女士把他们拉到一边。"我欣赏你们试图做的事情，"她温柔地说。"但这还没准备好。学生们看不到价值，技术对课堂使用来说太复杂了。"

回办公室的路上一片寂静。Jake盯着窗外。Sarah看起来快要哭了。Emily的脸无法解读。Alex感觉像被打了一拳。

### 第七部分：真相之夜

回到办公室，没人知道该说什么。

最后，Sarah开口了，她的声音很轻。"也许这是一个错误。也许我们还没准备好。"

"或者也许我们只需要改进我们所拥有的，"Emily说。"这在产品开发中是正常的。第一次测试通常会失败。"

"你说得容易，"Sarah厉声说。"你没有花几个月的时间建造这个。"

"没有，但我花了几年时间看什么有效什么无效。我可以告诉你，这种具体情况是可以解决的。"

Jake突然开口了。"我妹妹上周试了。她说的和今天那些学生一样的话。我不想提，因为我不想伤害任何人的感情。但也许那是错的。也许我们需要彼此更诚实。"

Alex看着他的团队。他们都看起来筋疲力尽、失望和担忧。但他们仍然在这里。

"你们都对，"Alex说。"Sarah，你说得对，这很难，失败很痛。Emily，你说得对，我们可以从中学习。Jake，你完全正确，我们需要诚实，即使这很困难。"

他站起来走到白板前。"所以让我们换个方式做这件事。让我们列出今天出错的一切。不辩护，不争论。只是诚实的观察。然后我们弄清楚如何解决每个问题。"

在接下来的三个小时里，他们一起工作。Sarah承认她太专注于技术功能，而不够关注实际可用性。Emily承认她一直太挑剔，没有提供足够的支持。Jake分享了他妹妹的详细反馈，他之前太紧张而不敢提起。

慢慢地，一幅新画面开始浮现。他们需要完全重新设计界面。他们需要专注于一个特定的用例，而不是试图解决每个问题。他们需要真正让教师和学生参与设计过程，而不仅仅是在最后与他们测试。

到午夜时，他们有了新计划。这意味着要扔掉他们的一些工作，在某些部分重新开始。但第一次，他们真正作为一个团队工作，而不仅仅是有共同目标的个人。

"我认为我们可以做到这一点，"Sarah看着满是笔记的白板说。"如果我们真正一起工作，我们可以做出真正有效的东西。"

"同意，"Emily说。"我保证在批评的同时给予更多的积极反馈。"

Jake微笑着。"我们可以订披萨吗？我有食物工作得更好。"

每个人都笑了，几周来一直在积累的紧张终于打破了。

Alex看着他的团队——这一小群选择在不确定的未来冒险的人。他们一起面对了第一次真正的失败。而不是分崩离析，他们变得更强大了。

"这只是开始，"他说。"我们还会再次失败。可能很多次。但如果我们继续学习并继续支持彼此，我们最终会建造出真正特别的东西。"

"为失败和学习干杯！"Jake举起他的咖啡杯。

"为失败和学习干杯！"其他人回应道。

当他们坐在破旧的办公室里，在午夜吃着披萨重新设计他们的产品时，Alex意识到一些重要的事情：建立公司真的不是关于产品或技术。而是关于人们以及他们通过挑战一起工作的能力。

尽管有所有困难，他们拥有宝贵的东西：一个愿意诚实、学习和继续尝试的团队。

这比任何完美的产品都更有价值。

2. Compare Sarah and Emily's approaches. Who was "right"? Can both be right in different ways?

3. Why was Jake's admission (about his sister's feedback) important for the team?

4. What did Alex learn about leadership in this chapter? What would you have done differently?

5. David said "failure is part of the process." Do you agree? How did failure actually help the team?

6. How did the team's relationship change from the beginning to the end of this chapter?

7. What does Emily bring to the team that Alex and Sarah lack?

8. Jake is the youngest and least experienced. Why is he valuable to the team?
