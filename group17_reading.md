## 📖 Reading Passage: Above and Below

Tom was a **pilot** who **spent** most of his **time** **above** the **clouds**. His **job** took him **high** **above** the **ground**, **far** from the **daily** **concerns** of **people** **below**.

One day, his **plane** had a **technical** **problem** and he **needed** to **make** an **emergency** **landing** in a **small** **village**. **For** the **first** **time** in **years**, Tom **found** **himself** **firmly** on the **ground**, **unable** to **fly** **above** it.

The **village** was **simple**. **People** **here** didn't **care** about **flying** **above** the **world** – they **cared** about the **world** **beneath** their **feet**. They **grew** **food**, **raised** **families**, **helped** **neighbors**. **Life** **below** the **clouds** was **very** **different** from **life** **above** them.

"**How** do you **live** **down** **here** without **wanting** to **go** **above**?" Tom **asked** a **farmer** named **Pedro**.

Pedro **laughed**. "We don't **need** to **go** **above** to **be** **happy**. **Everything** we **need** is **right** **here**, **below** our **feet** and **around** us."

Tom **spent** **three** **days** in the **village** **while** his **plane** was **being** **repaired**. During that **time**, he **learned** to **see** the **beauty** **below** that he'd **missed** from **above**. The **details** of **life** – **children** **playing**, **bread** **baking**, **friends** **talking** – were **invisible** from **above** but **precious** **below**.

"I've been **living** **above** for so **long**," Tom **realized**, "that I **forgot** **about** the **life** **below**."

When his **plane** was **ready**, Tom **felt** **torn**. Part of him **wanted** to **return** **above** the **clouds**, but **another** **part** **wanted** to **stay** **below** and **experience** **more** of this **grounded** **life**.

"You don't **have** to **choose** **between** **above** and **below**," Pedro **told** him. "You **can** **appreciate** **both**. **Flying** **above** gives you **perspective**. **Living** **below** gives you **connection**. **Both** are **important**."

Tom **nodded**. He would **continue** **flying** **above** the **clouds**, but now he would **never** **forget** the **lessons** he'd **learned** **below**. **Life** wasn't just about **soaring** **above** – it was **also** about **staying** **connected** to what was **below**.

As he **flew** **away**, Tom **looked** **down** at the **village** **below**. From **above**, it **looked** **tiny**. But he **knew** now that **size** **didn't** **matter**. What **mattered** was the **life** **lived** **below**, the **connections** **made**, the **moments** **shared**.

**Above** or **below** – **both** had their **place**. And Tom was **grateful** to **understand** **both**.
