# Chapter 28: Boss Expectations

**Thursday** morning, Sarah called Alex into her office. The **general** atmosphere in the newsroom was tense—budget meetings had been scheduled for next week, and everyone was trying to prove their value through exceptional work. Alex had just finished his third **general**-interest community story in as many weeks, and he felt like he was finding his rhythm.

"Sit," Sarah said, gesturing **towards** the chair across from her desk. Her **expression** was serious.

Alex sat, trying to read her mood. Was he in trouble? He'd hit all his deadlines, checked all his facts, followed every **procedure** Diana had taught him.

"Your work is fine," Sarah began, which **somehow** felt worse than **direct** criticism. "You write cleanly, you verify sources, you meet deadlines. You're doing exactly what I asked you to do."

"Is that bad?"

"It's **average**," Sarah said, not unkindly. "And **average** won't cut it in this industry anymore. We need journalism that breaks through the noise, that makes people stop and **pay** **attention**. Your stories are **safe**, Alex. They're the journalistic **equivalent** of beige **clothes**—perfectly **appropriate** but completely **forget**table."

Alex felt heat rise in his face. He wanted to **blame** the limitations she'd put on him—**assign**ing him **only** community stories, restricting his access to bigger investigations. But he knew she was **right**. His stories were **competent** but not memorable.

"What do you **recommend**?" he asked.

"I want you to **explore** a **novel** **approach** to the stories you're already covering. Stop writing like you're **afraid** to have a **perspective**. Find your **voice**."

"But journalists are supposed to be **objective**—"

"Objectivity doesn't **mean** **boring**," Sarah interrupted. "You can be **fair** and still write with **energy**, with **insight**, with a **unique** **lens** on the **world**. **Let** me show you something."

She pulled up an article on her screen. "This is a piece about a **bus** driver **strike** from 1972. Read the opening."

Alex leaned forward and read: "At 5:47 AM, while the city slept, Maria Santos stood alone at the **bus** stop on Elm Street, realizing for the first time in thirty years that the **bus** would not come. The **strike** had **begin** twelve hours earlier, but its **real** impact wasn't measured in **cancel**ed routes or **traffic** **jam**s. It was measured in moments like this—a domestic worker facing the **impossible** choice between a two-hour **walk** to her **work** or missing a shift she couldn't **afford** to **lose**."

"**Wow**," Alex said.

"That's Tom Henderson's work from when he was your age. Notice what he does? He doesn't start with **official** statements or **statistic**s. He starts with a **human** **being** facing a **moral** **consequence** of a **political** **decision**. It's still **fair**—he covers the **union**'s **perspective**, the city's **position**, all of it. But he gives readers a reason to **care**."

"I don't know if I can write like that," Alex admitted.

"Not yet. But you can **learn**. Here's your **assignment**: I want you to **participate** in the annual **youth** **exchange** program **session** next **week**—high school students from different neighborhoods coming together to discuss **topic**s like **race**, **economic** **inequality**, **identity**. But I don't want a **straight** recap. I want you to find one **human** story that **capture**s something **essential** about **youth** **navigate**ing our **divide**d city."

Alex nodded, taking notes. "What **approach** should I take?"

"That's for you to **explore**. **Gather** details, **observe** dynamics, **listen** for the moments that **reveal** something **deeper**. And Alex? This isn't about writing what you **think** I want. It's about **discover**ing what you **see** that **no** **one** else does."

**After** leaving Sarah's office, Alex felt simultaneously energized and terrified. This was a **direct** challenge to grow beyond **competence** **towards** something more.

He spent the afternoon researching the **youth** **exchange** program. It had started five years ago in response to **racial** tensions following a **police** **shoot**ing. The **intent** was to **ensure** students from affluent neighborhoods in the **north** and struggling neighborhoods in the **south** could **connect**, **discuss**, **learn** from each other. The **general** **consensus** was that it worked well, though critics argued it was more **symbol**ic than **substance**ive.

That evening, Alex rode the **bus** home, watching the city transform as they moved through different neighborhoods. He noticed how passengers **change**d—the **clothes** people wore, the languages spoken, the **invisible** **border**s marking **economic** **divide**s. A woman with a **cat** carrier sat across from him. An elderly man clutched a bottle of **medicine** from the pharmacy. He'd been covering community stories, but had he **really** been **see**ing the communities?

On **Thursday**, the **weather** turned cold and wet as Alex arrived at the community center hosting the **exchange** program. About forty students filled the **room**, split roughly equally between schools from different parts of the city. The **category** differences were **obvious**—some kids wore designer **clothes** and carried expensive phones, while others had worn jackets and **handle**d their **belong**ings with **careful** **attention**.

The **session** began with **ice**-**break**ers. Alex positioned himself at the side, **observe**ing rather than **participate**ing **direct**ly. He noticed a **young** **African** **America**n girl, maybe sixteen, sitting slightly apart. Her **dress** was simple but **clean**, her **expression** guarded. She hadn't **participate**d in the **introduce**ions.

During the first discussion **topic**—"What does **home** **mean** to you?"—she finally spoke. "**Home** is where you **fight** to **stay**," she said quietly. "My **grandmother** raised me after my mom died. She **work**s two jobs to **keep** our apartment. **Every** month we wonder if we can **make** **rent**. That's **home**—the place you **fight** not to **lose**."

The **room** went **quiet**. A **boy** from the **north**ern school, wearing a **college** sweatshirt, said: "I never thought about **home** that way. For me it's just... **where** I live. I never worried we'd **lose** it."

"Must be nice," another student said, not unkindly but **direct**ly.

Alex scribbled notes, sensing this **exchange** mattered. The **map** of the city's **divide**s was being drawn in **real** time through these students' **experience**s.

During lunch, Alex **approach**ed the girl who'd spoken about **home**. Students were eating sandwiches and hard-boiled **egg**s provided by the program. "Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a **report**er covering the program. Would you be willing to **talk**?"

She studied him. "You going to make me sound like a **victim**? Because I'm not. I'm **proud** of my **grandmother**, **proud** of where I'm from."

"I don't **intend** to make you sound like anything except **exact**ly who you are," Alex said. "But I understand if you'd rather not **talk**."

**After** a moment, she nodded. "I'm **Jasmine**. And **yeah**, we can **talk**. But I get to read what you write before you **publish** it. That's my condition."

"**Fair**," Alex agreed, knowing Sarah would approve. "Can we start with your **name** and why you **decide**d to **participate** in this program?"

Over the next thirty minutes, **Jasmine** **explain**ed her **world**—a **youth** growing up in a neighborhood marked by **economic** **struggle** but rich in **community** **spirit**. Her **grandmother** **cook**ed meals for elderly **neighbor**s, organized **youth** **program**s, fought against **landlord**s who tried to **force** families out. "That's **mine** to **protect**," **Jasmine** said of her neighborhood. She **want**ed to become a **teacher**, specifically to **return** to her neighborhood and **work** at the **school** she'd attended.

"People from outside always **act** like our neighborhoods just need **fix**ing," she said. "Like we're **broke**n and need **rich** people to **save** us. But we **save** **ourselves** **every** day. We **just** need **resource**s, **respect**, and to not be **push**ed out by **development** that doesn't **serve** us."

"That's a powerful **perspective**," Alex said.

"It's not a **perspective**, it's my **life**," **Jasmine** corrected him.

During the afternoon **session**, focused on **education** **inequality**, tensions rose. A **white** student argued that everyone had **equal** opportunity if they "just worked hard." **Jasmine** and several other students **push**ed back, explaining how school **fund**ing formulas, **resource** **distribution**, and **historic** **policy**s created **fundamental** **unequal**ity.

"It's not a **competition** where everyone starts at the same line," **Jasmine** said. "Some of us start miles behind, and pretending we don't is **dishonest**."

The **facilitate**r—a **youth** **worker** named **Marcus** (not the same **Marcus** from Alex's newsroom)—guided the **discussion** with **skill**, ensuring all **voice**s were heard without letting anyone dominate. Alex **observe**d how the students slowly began to **listen** to each other, moving from **defend**ive positions **towards** **genuine** **understand**ing.

A **gay** student from the **north**ern school spoke about feeling **invisible** in his own **family**, how **identity** struggles crossed **economic** lines. An **Asian** student discussed being **caught** between **culture**s, **expect**ed to be a "model **minority**" while **navigate**ing **race** **relation**s that never **quite** **accept**ed her. The **session** became a **map** of **overlap**ping **struggle**s, moments where students **recognize**d shared **challenge**s despite different **context**s.

**By** the end, **Jasmine** **exchange**d **contact** information with several students from other schools. She was more **active** in conversations now, more **engage**d. Alex watched her laugh at something one of them said, her guarded **expression** softening into something more **open**.

**After** the program concluded, Alex **approach**ed **Marcus** the **facilitate**r. "How do you **measure** **success** for something like this?"

"**Honestly**? It's **hard** to **measure** **academic**ally or **scientific**ally. But I **see** it in small moments—students who walked in with **wall**s up, **walk**ing out with **question**s instead of **assumption**s. That's not a **victory** we can **quantify**, but it **matter**s."

"Can I **quote** you on that?"

"Sure. But **here**'s something else to **consider**: these **youth** **expose** more **truth** in two hours of honest **discussion** than most **adult**s **manage** in **year**s of **political** **debate**. That's the **real** story."

That evening, Alex sat in his apartment with his notes **spread** across his desk. He had **lot**s of **material**—quotes, **observe**ations, moments that **capture**d the **complex**ity of **youth** **navigate**ing **divide**d communities. But how to **shape** it into the kind of story Sarah had **challenge**d him to write?

He remembered Tom Henderson's **bus** **strike** article—starting with a **human** moment that **reveal**ed larger **truth**s. Alex began **write**ing:

"**Jasmine** **Williams** (not her **real** **name** at her request) has a **map** in her bedroom. It shows her neighborhood in the **south** **part** of the city, marked with **location**s of **family** friends, **safe** **space**s, and the apartment her **grandmother** has fought for **year**s to **keep**. Twelve miles **north**, **another** student at the **youth** **exchange** program admitted he'd never seen a **map** of the city—he'd **never** **need**ed one because his **family** had always lived in the same **area**, **secure** and **stable**.

"This **gap**—between those who **map** their **world** out of **necessity** and those who **navigate** without **conscious** **effort**—defined last **Thursday**'s **annual** **youth** **exchange** **session**, where forty high school students **spend** six hours **explore**ing what **divide**s their **share**d city and **possibly** what **connect**s it."

Alex continued **write**ing, weaving **Jasmine**'s story with the broader **discussion**, using **specific** **detail**s—the **weather** outside, the **quality** of **light** in the **room**, the **subtle** **shift** in **energy** when students moved from **defend**ing **position**s to **actual** **listen**ing.

He wrote until past midnight, then **read** the draft aloud. It felt different from his **past** work—more **alive**, more **willing** to **engage** with **complex**ity rather than **safe**ly summarizing **event**s.

Friday morning, he sent the draft to Sarah with a note: "This is the most **honest** story I've written. I hope it's what you were **push**ing me **towards**."

Her response came within an hour: "**Come** to my office."

Alex's heart **pound**ed as he walked to Sarah's **glass** **wall**ed space. Was it **terrible**? Had he **fail**ed to **understand** her **challenge**?

Sarah gestured for him to sit. "This is good work, Alex. **Really** good. You found your **entry** **point**, you **develop**ed a **voice**, and you **engage**d with **substance** instead of just **report**ing **surface**."

"So you'll **publish** it?"

"With some edits, **yeah**. But more importantly, this is the **level** I know you can **operate** at. This is the **approach** I want you to **bring** to **every** **assignment**. Not **safe**, **competent** **report**ing—but **brave**, **insight**ful **journal**ism."

"It's **scary** to **write** like this," Alex admitted. "I kept worrying I was **overstep**ping, **insert**ing too much **perspective**."

"You **balance**d it well. You let **Jasmine** and the other students **speak** for themselves, but you also **shape**d the **narrative** to **reveal** patterns and **mean**ing. That's the **technique** good feature **write**rs **master**—**serve** the **truth** without **disappear**ing into **fake** **object**ivity."

"Diana said something **similar** about **acknowledge**ing our **human**ity while maintaining **standard**s."

"Diana's **right**. And Alex? This **depend**s on you **continue**ing to **push** yourself. Don't **settle** back into **safe** **write**ing now that you've **prove**n you can do better."

Walking back to his desk, Alex felt something shift in his **understand**ing of his role. Sarah wasn't just his **editor**—she was **push**ing him to become the **journal**ist he could **potentially** be. The **expect**ations were high, **possibly** **impossible** at times, but they were **trust** in his **capability** to **rise** to challenges.

**Marcus** (his newsroom colleague) noticed his **expression**. "You look **either** **terrified** or **thrill**ed. Can't tell which."

"Both," Alex said. "Sarah just **approve**d my **youth** **exchange** story."

"Nice! First piece where you found your **voice**?"

"**How** did you know?"

"Because I remember that **exact** **feel**ing—the moment when you **real**ize you can write something **honest** instead of just **adequate**. It's **scary** and **excite**ing, and it **change**s everything."

That weekend, Alex's story **publish**ed **online** and in the following **Monday**'s print edition. It generated **significant** **reaction**—comments praising the **honest** **portrait** of **youth** **navigate**ing **inequality**, a few criticizing him for being "too **political**," and several readers **share**ing their own **experience**s of **economic** **divide** in the city. Marcus from the newsroom invited him for a celebratory drink—"just beer, not **wine**, since we're still broke **reporter**s"—but Alex was too exhausted and declined. "This whole **affair** has drained me," he admitted.

But the **comment** that **mean**t most came from an email **address** Alex **recognize**d: **Jasmine**. She'd read the final version and wrote simply: "You got it **right**. Thank you for **listen**ing."

Alex printed the email and **tack**ed it to his desk **wall**, a reminder of what journalism could be when it moved beyond **safe** **report**ing **towards** **truth**ful engagement with people's lives.

Sarah had **challenge**d him to grow, and **somehow**—through **fear** and effort and **honest** **attempt**—he had. Not completely, not perfectly, but **genuine**ly.

And that felt like a **victory** worth **celebrate**ing, even as he **recognize**d it was just the **begin**ning of **learn**ing how to do this work at the **level** it **demand**ed.
