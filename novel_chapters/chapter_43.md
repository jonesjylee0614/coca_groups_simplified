# Chapter 43: Family Phone Calls

Sunday morning arrived with **dark** clouds hanging low over the **city**. Alex sat **outside** on his fire escape despite the **cold**, his phone balanced on the railing as he waited **for** his parents' **call**. This weekly **ritual** had become both a comfort and a source of **stress**—a **transition** between his new **life** and his **childhood** in Riverside.

The phone rang **soon** enough, and his mother's voice filled the line. "Alex! How are you, sweetheart?"

"I'm **well**, Mom. **Busy** with **work**, but **good**."

"You always **say** that," she said, her **tone** **fairly** **worried**. "Are you eating **properly**? Getting enough **sleep**?"

"I'm **fine**, I **promise**." Alex watched a **pigeon** peck at crumbs on the fire escape **below**, the morning **landscape** seeming to **stretch** endlessly behind it. "How are you and Dad?"

"Your father's playing **golf** again, despite what the doctor said about his back. **Scared** me half to death last **week** when he could barely **walk** afterward." Her voice **dropped** to a **whisper**. "I'm **worried** about him, Alex. He won't **stop** and **rest**. Says every **complaint** I make will **suck** the fun out of everything."

"Is he there? Can I **talk** to him?"

"He's in the **kitchen**, making **breakfast**. Let me **get** him." Alex heard her **call** out, then footsteps, then his father's gruff voice.

"Son! How's the big **city** treating you?"

"**Pretty** **well**, actually. I'm **working** on some **interesting** stories."

"That's my **boy**. Always **chasing** the truth." His father's **pride** was evident, though he tried to hide it. "Your mother **tells** me you're **dating** someone. A **teacher**?"

"Jamie, yeah. She's **great**, Dad. **Really** **smart**, **cares** **deeply** about her **students**."

"**Good**, **good**. A **teacher's** a **solid** **choice**—stable **job**, **pension**, **health** insurance. Not **like** journalism, where you're always one **budget** **cut** **away** from the unemployment line."

Alex bit his **tongue**. His father meant **well**, but the **constant** **comparison** between his "**unstable**" career and more "**reasonable**" professions wore on him. "It's not about **stability**, Dad. I'm **doing** what I **love**."

"I **know**, I **know**." His father **sighed**. "Just **want** you to be **happy**. And **secure**. Your mother **worries** herself **sick** about you **living** in that **dangerous** **city**."

"It's not **dangerous**, Dad. **Well**, not the **whole** **city**. You **read** too **many** **scary** stories. Last **week** there was a **killer** arrested, but that doesn't **mean** every street is **violent**."

"I **read** YOUR stories, son. You **write** about **crime**, **poverty**, **violence**. Don't tell me it's **safe**. You covered that story about the **immigrant** family who was **unable** to **pay** rent, and the **suicide** rates among **youth**—every **symptom** points to **danger**."

Alex **poured** himself more **coffee** from the **thermos** he'd brought **outside**. "I **write** about **problems** **because** they **need** to be **addressed**. That doesn't **mean** I'm in **danger** every **day**."

His mother came back on the line. "Are you taking care of yourself? **Drinking** enough **water**? I **read** an article about young people and **alcohol** consumption in **cities**—also something about **therapy** becoming more common, which made me wonder if you're talking to someone about the **stress**—"

"Mom, I'm not developing an **alcohol** problem, and I don't need **therapy**."

"I didn't **say** you **were** or did! I'm just **concerned**. You **sound** **tired**. And no **offense**, but talking to a professional isn't something to be ashamed of. It's not a **personality** flaw to **acquire** help when you need it."

"I am **tired**. But it's **good** **tired**. From **working** on **meaningful** projects."

There was a **pause**, then his mother said, "We're **proud** of you, sweetheart. **Really**. We just **miss** you. The house feels so **empty** without you."

**Guilt** began to **wash** over Alex like a **wave**. "I **miss** you too, Mom. **Both** of you."

"When will you **visit**? It's been months."

"I **can't** **right** now. Too **many** **deadlines**. But **maybe** **soon**. **Maybe** **next** **month**?"

"You said that last **month**," she reminded him **gently**.

They talked **for** another **twenty** minutes, his mother **sharing** **news** about **neighbors** and **relatives**. Mrs. Henderson's **hip** surgery went **well**. The Johnson's **son** was getting **married**. Someone he'd gone to **high** **school** with was now **pregnant** with her **third** **child**. His **favorite** **teacher** had retired. The town was installing **solar** panels on the **library**. The income **distribution** in Riverside remained **fairly** **equal**, unlike the **city** where the **gap** between rich and **poor** kept getting **lower** and **lower** **for** those at the **bottom**.

Each **update** felt like a **reminder** of the **life** he'd **left** **behind**, the **alternative** **path** he could have **taken**. He could be in Riverside **now**, working at the local **paper**, **living** in a **house** instead of a **tiny** **apartment**, **near** his **parents** and **childhood** **friends**. It would be **easier**, **cheaper**, **more** **comfortable**. But it wouldn't be **this**—this **challenging**, **exhilarating**, **meaningful** **work** in the **center** of **everything**.

When they finally **hung** up, Alex sat **alone** on the fire escape, **feeling** the **weight** of **distance**. His phone **buzzed** almost immediately—Jamie.

"Morning! Want to grab **breakfast**? There's a new **place** that **serves** amazing **pancakes**."

He **smiled** despite the **melancholy** the **call** had **stirred** up. "That **sounds** **perfect**. Give me **thirty** minutes?"

"Take your **time**. I'll **meet** you there."

Alex went **back** **inside** and **changed** into **clean** clothes. As he **buttoned** his **shirt**, his phone rang again—this **time** his younger **sister**, Emma, who he'd thought would be **sleeping** in.

"Hey, Em. What's up?"

"Mom just called me **crying**," Emma said without **preamble**. "Said you **sounded** **distant** and **stressed**."

"I wasn't **distant**. I was just—" Alex **stopped**, **frustrated**, **unbuttoning** the top **button** of his **shirt** as the morning **heat** rose. "Why does she **do** that? Analyze every **word** I **say**?"

"Because she **loves** you, **dumbass**. And she's **worried**. We **all** are."

"There's **nothing** to **worry** about."

"Really? **Because** you **sound** **defensive** **right** now." Emma's voice **softened**. "Look, I'm not **trying** to **give** you a **hard** **time**. But from our **perspective**, you're **far** **away**, working **crazy** **hours** at a **struggling** **newspaper**, barely making **money**, in a **city** where **rent** costs more than most **people's** **salaries**. Can you **understand** why **that's** **concerning**? Mom's not your **opponent** here—she's your biggest **supporter**."

Alex **sat** on his **bed**, suddenly **exhausted**. "I **get** it. I **really** **do**. But **this** is what I **chose**. **This** is my **dream**."

"And we **support** that. Genuinely. But **you** **need** to **understand** our **perspective** too. Every **time** you **mention** a story about **crime** or **poverty** or **whatever**, Mom **imagines** you in **danger**. Every **time** you **sound** **tired**, Dad **thinks** you're working yourself to **death**."

"So what **should** I **do**? **Quit** and **come** **home**? **Give** up?"

"No, **you** **idiot**. Just **call** more **often**. Share **good** **news** along with the **hard** **stuff**. Tell them about Jamie. Tell them about your **achievements**. Let them **feel** **connected** to your **life**, not just **worried** about it. And don't **pretend** everything is **perfect** when it's not—they can tell."

Emma was **right**, as usual. "When did you get so **wise**?"

"I've always been **wise**. You were just too **busy** being the **golden** **child** to **notice**." She **laughed**. "Seriously, though. Mom and Dad are just **scared** of **losing** you. Not **physically**, but... **emotionally**. Like you'll become this **big** **city** **person** who doesn't **need** them **anymore**. They want to stay **in** **touch** with who you're becoming."

"I'll **always** **need** them," Alex said quietly. "I'm just... I'm **trying** to **figure** out how to be **who** I am **here** while **still** being their **son** from Riverside. It's a **hard** **balance**. A **matter** of **philosophy**, almost—can you be two **versions** of yourself at once?"

"I **know**. But you're **smart** enough to **figure** it out." Emma **paused**. "Now tell me about this **teacher** you're **dating**. **Please** tell me she's **better** than that **awful** **girl** you **dated** **senior** **year**. The one who made you **dig** a **hole** in your **self**-**esteem**."

Alex **laughed**, the **tension** **breaking**. He **spent** the **next** **fifteen** minutes **telling** Emma about Jamie, about their **dates**, about how she **made** him **feel** **grounded** even when **everything** else felt **chaotic**.

"She **sounds** **perfect** for you," Emma said. "Someone who **gets** the **work** you **do** but also **reminds** you there's **life** **beyond** it. Don't **screw** this up, big brother."

"I'll **try** not to. **Thanks** for **calling**, Em. And **for** the **reality** **check**."

"Anytime. **Love** you."

"**Love** you too."

After **hanging** up, Alex **checked** the **time**—he was going to be **late** **meeting** Jamie if he didn't **leave** **soon**. But **first**, he **sent** a **quick** **text** to his **parents**: "Sorry if I **seemed** **off** **earlier**. I'm **really** **doing** **okay**. **Proud** of the **work** I'm **doing**, **happy** with Jamie, **grateful** for everything you've **given** me. **Love** you **both**. Will **visit** **soon**, I **promise**."

His mother's **reply** came **before** he even **put** his phone **down**: "We **love** you so much, sweetheart. Just **want** you to be **happy** and **safe**. **Proud** of you every **day**."

The **restaurant** where he met Jamie was **crowded**, full of **families** having **Sunday** **brunch**. Jamie was **already** there, **sitting** at a **small** **table** by the **window**, **reading** something on her phone.

"Hey," he said, **sliding** into the **seat** **across** from her.

She **looked** up and **smiled**, but her expression **shifted** when she saw his **face**. "What's **wrong**?"

"Nothing's **wrong**. Just **family** **stuff**."

"Want to **talk** about it?"

He **considered** **lying**, but that would **defeat** the **whole** **point** of Emma's **advice**. "My parents called. They **worry** about me **constantly**. Sometimes it **feels** like they **can't** see me as anything **other** than their **kid** who might be in **danger** or **failing** or... I don't **know**. It's **complicated**. A large **portion** of every **conversation** is them **worrying** about my **safety**."

Jamie reached **across** the **table** and took his **hand**. "That's **because** they **love** you. My parents are the same **way**. I'm **thirty** **years** **old**, and my mom **still** **calls** to **make** **sure** I'm **eating** vegetables."

"Does it **get** **easier**?"

"Kind of? You **learn** to **accept** that they'll **always** **worry**, and you **get** **better** at **managing** their **expectations**. It **helps** to **share** the **good** **stuff** more **deliberately**. When I got my **teaching** **award** last **year**, I made a **big** **deal** of **telling** them about it. **Gave** them something **positive** to **focus** on instead of just their **worries**."

"That's **basically** what my **sister** said."

"Your **sister** **sounds** **smart**."

The **waitress** brought **menus**, and they **ordered**—**pancakes** for Jamie, **eggs** and **toast** for Alex. As they **waited** for their **food**, Jamie **told** him about a **student** who'd been **struggling** with **reading** but finally had a **breakthrough** that **week**.

"He was so **proud** of himself," she said, her **face** **lighting** up. "He **read** an **entire** **paragraph** without **help**. It might not **sound** like a **big** **achievement** to most **people**, but for him, it was **everything**."

"That's the **kind** of **story** that **matters**," Alex said. "Those **individual** **moments** of **triumph**. I **write** about **big** **issues**—**policy**, **politics**, **systemic** **problems**. Sometimes I **forget** about the **individual** **people** **affected**."

"You **can't** **lose** **sight** of that," Jamie said **seriously**. "The **statistics** matter, but so **do** the **personal** stories. That's what **makes** **people** **care**."

Their **food** arrived, and as they **ate**, Alex felt the **stress** of the morning's **phone** **calls** **fading**. This was what he **needed**—**connection**, **understanding**, someone who **got** him.

"I've been **thinking**," Jamie said, **pouring** **syrup** over her **pancakes**. "You **should** write a **column** about the **distance** between **small** **towns** and **big** **cities**. Not just **geographically**, but **culturally**, **economically**, **philosophically**. The way **people** in Riverside see the **world** versus how **people** here **do**. It could be **really** **powerful**."

"That's... actually a **great** **idea**," Alex said, his **mind** **already** **working**. "I could **talk** to other **people** who **made** the same **transition**. **Analyze** the **gaps** in **understanding**. The **cultural** **deficit** between **urban** and **rural** America."

"See? I'm **capable** of **good** **ideas** when not **distracted** by **work**," Jamie said with a **grin**.

They **finished** **breakfast** and **walked** through the **neighborhood**, the **Sunday** **streets** **quieter** than **weekdays**. Jamie pointed out **changes**—a new **cafe**, a **closed** **bookstore**, construction on an **old** **building**.

"The **city's** **constantly** **changing**," she **observed**. "Sometimes I **wonder** if **small** **towns** have the **right** **idea**—keeping **things** the **same**, **preserving** what **works**."

"But **without** **change**, there's no **progress**," Alex **countered**. "No **growth**, no **evolution**."

"True. But there's **value** in **stability** too. In **knowing** your **neighbors**, in **traditions** that **last**, in **communities** that **stay** **together**."

They **debated** the **point** **good**-**naturedly** as they **walked**, neither **fully** **convinced** by the other's **position** but **enjoying** the **conversation**. This was what Alex **valued** most about Jamie—she **challenged** his **thinking**, **made** him **consider** **alternative** **perspectives**, **pushed** him to be **sharper** in his **arguments**.

Back at his **apartment**, Jamie **kissed** him goodbye. "Thanks for **breakfast**. And for **sharing** about your **family**. I **know** that's not **easy** for you."

"Thanks for **listening**. And for the **column** **idea**. I **think** I'll **pitch** it to Sarah this **week**."

After she **left**, Alex **opened** his **laptop** and **started** **writing** **notes**. Jamie was **right**—there was a **powerful** **story** in the **divide** between where he came from and where he was now. Not just his **personal** **transition**, but the **broader** **cultural** **split** between **rural** and **urban** America, between **tradition** and **change**, between **comfort** and **ambition**.

His phone **buzzed**—another **text** from his mother, with a **photo** of his **father** in the **yard**, **holding** a **golf** **club** and **grinning**. "Your **dad** wanted me to send this. He says to tell you he's **not** **giving** up **golf**, no matter what the doctor says. **Stubborn** **man**!"

Alex **smiled** and **texted** **back**: "He **gets** his **stubbornness** from you, Mom. **Love** the **photo**. Tell him to take it **easy**."

The **distance** between Riverside and the **city** was **real**—**geographical**, **cultural**, **emotional**. But so was the **love** that **bridged** it, the **family** **ties** that **held** despite the **miles** and the **differences**. Alex was **building** a new **life** here, becoming a new **version** of himself, but he didn't **have** to **lose** his **roots** in the **process**.

He could be **both**—a **small**-**town** **boy** who **grew** up on **family** **dinners** and **high** **school** **football** games, and a **big**-**city** **journalist** **covering** **important** **stories** and **dating** an **amazing** **teacher**. He could **honor** where he came from while **embracing** where he was going.

The **phone** **calls** would **continue** every **Sunday**, with all their **complexity**—the **worry**, the **love**, the **pride**, the **concern**, the **complaints**, the **support**. And Alex would **keep** **trying** to **navigate** the **balance** between **independence** and **connection**, between **his** **new** **life** and **his** **old** **one**, between being his **parents'** **son** and being his **own** **man**.

It wasn't **easy**. But it was **worth** it. And with **people** **like** Jamie and Emma to **remind** him of what **mattered**, he thought he might just **manage** to **figure** it out.

**Outside**, the **dark** clouds **finally** **broke**, and rain **began** to **pour** down on the **city**. But **inside** his **apartment**, Alex felt **warm** and **grounded**, **connected** to **both** his **past** and his **present**, **ready** to **face** whatever **came** **next**.
