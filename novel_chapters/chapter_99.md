# Chapter 99: Future Vision

Alex sat at a **downtown** coffee shop on a crisp autumn morning, a **blank canvas** of possibilities spread before him in the form of a notebook and three job offers. Outside the window, leaves swirled like his thoughts—circular, restless, searching for where to land. He took a sip of **soda**—actually coffee, but the **fizz**—the energy he needed felt similar.

The first offer lay on top: Senior Investigative Reporter at The National Voice, a position that would catapult him into the highest **throne** of American journalism. Six-figure salary, unlimited resources, the kind of platform that could **punch** through national discourse. His college **rival** would probably see the announcement and feel a **blast** of envy.

The second: a book deal from a prestigious publisher. They wanted him to write about his Heartland Voices project, expanding it into a **canvas** of American identity. Advance was substantial, timeline **flexible**—**short-term** commitment but long-term impact.

The third: an adjunct teaching position at his alma mater's journalism school. **Modest**—**steep** pay cut, but the chance to shape the next generation, to be more than just a **solo** practitioner of journalism but a **developmental** force in the field.

"**Aah**," he sighed, running his hand through his hair. The **irony** wasn't lost on him—five years ago, he would have **desperately** wanted any one of these offers. Now, having all three felt like a burden rather than a blessing. Too many good options created their own paralysis.

His phone buzzed. Margaret: "Have you decided yet? National Voice is pressuring for an answer. They need to know by Friday."

Alex typed back: "Still thinking. This is harder than I expected."

"Life gets complicated when you're good at what you do," she replied. "Whatever you choose, make sure it's what YOU want, not what you think you should want. And **verify** your motivations. Don't let **ego** drive the decision."

Sound advice from a **loyal** mentor who'd guided him through every major career milestone. Alex put the phone in his **drawer**—actually his bag—and returned to his notes.

He'd made a list of pros and cons for each option, trying to be systematic, rational. But how do you **verify** the right choice when all paths lead somewhere **valuable**—worthwhile? The National Voice offered power and prestige. The book offered creative control and lasting impact. Teaching offered meaning and connection.

A woman at the next table was working on her laptop, and he overheard her video call: "Mom, I'm **happily** pursuing what I love, even if it doesn't pay well. Isn't that worth something?" The **parental** voice responded with concern about practicality, about security. The woman looked **socially** exhausted from the conversation.

Alex recognized the conversation—he'd had variations of it with his own parents over the years. The tension between **ideal** and practical, between passion and pragmatism. In **spite** of all his success, he still felt that **punch** of doubt sometimes. He absently stirred his coffee, watching the **ash**-gray remnants of sugar dissolve.

A **comic** walked past the window, street performer juggling for tips—someone who'd chosen art over security, performance over stability. Alex wondered if they ever regretted it, if they **strive**d for something else, or if they'd found their **ideal** life already.

His notebook lay open to a page where he'd written: "What do I actually want?" Below it, **scratch**ed attempts at answers:

- To make a difference? (All three options offer this)
- To be recognized? (**Brutal** honesty: yes, but that shouldn't be the primary driver)
- To maintain work-life balance? (Teaching wins here)
- To grow as a writer? (Book wins here)
- To have maximum impact? (National Voice wins here)

The **projection**s he'd made about his future—career **trajectory**—career path had always been linear: bigger publications, bigger stories, upward mobility. But maybe that was **propaganda** he'd absorbed about what success looked like, not what he genuinely wanted.

He thought about the **listener**s—the readers his work served. Who needed his voice most? The National Voice reached millions but competed with hundreds of other strong journalists. His book would **aid** readers in understanding divided America, filling a **gap**—a **chunk** of missing nuance in public discourse. Teaching would help future journalists **inherit** the skills and ethics the profession needed.

A **disabled** veteran came into the coffee shop, service dog at his side, and Alex recognized him—he'd interviewed him for a piece on VA healthcare two years ago. The man ordered at the **counter**, saw Alex, and came over.

"Alex Morgan, right? You wrote about my **legal**—my **courtroom** battle with the VA. That story helped. After it ran, the **proceedings** got expedited. Just wanted to say thank you."

They talked for a few minutes, and the man shared that he'd since become an advocate for other veterans, using his experience to **aid** others navigating the system. "Your journalism gave me a platform when I felt voiceless," he said. "That matters more than you probably know."

After he left, Alex sat quietly, feeling the weight of **appreciation** and responsibility. This was why he did the work—not for awards or prestige, but for moments like this. For making **public** what had been hidden, for giving voice to the voiceless.

He pulled out his phone and called his father.

"Hey, Dad. Got a minute?"

"For you? Always. What's going on?"

Alex explained the three offers, his inability to decide, the **disappointment** he felt in himself for not knowing what he wanted.

His father listened without interrupting, then said: "Son, you're looking at this wrong. You're not choosing one path forever. You're choosing what to do next. These aren't three different lives—they're three different chapters. Maybe you take the book deal, spend a year writing, then teach. Or teach first, learn from students, then take the big job with fresh perspective. **Heck**, maybe you figure out how to do all three **partially**."

"I hadn't thought about it that way," Alex admitted.

"You're young," his father continued. "You've got time to **strive** for multiple goals. Your mother and I raised you on a farm, ran a hardware store for thirty years, then she started painting and I took up woodworking. Life isn't one **canvas**—it's a whole **gallery**. Different rooms, different phases."

After they hung up, Alex felt something shift—not a **magical** clarity, but a loosening of the **brutal** pressure he'd put on himself. The decision didn't have to be perfect or permanent. It just had to be **honest**—**true** to where he was now.

He opened his laptop and started writing—not to decide, but to explore. He wrote about what each path might look like, what a day in each life might feel like. The **solo** research and writing of book authorship. The collaborative energy of a big newsroom. The **developmental** satisfaction of watching students grow.

The National Voice position would mean more prestige but also more politics. He'd seen how big institutions could become **corrupt** not through malice but through bureaucracy, how **compassion** could get lost in pursuit of clicks and ratings. He'd have to navigate **re-election** **cycles**—**re-election** campaigns, advocacy groups, powerful interests that would try to **whip** up controversy or influence coverage. He'd covered stories about everything from political **offender**s to art **collector**s, even a piece about **Dutch** immigration patterns—the range would be vast.

The book would give him space to think deeply, to move beyond **short-term** news cycles into lasting analysis. He could take the **chunk** of knowledge he'd gathered and shape it into something **enduring**—**permanent**. But books were **lonely**—**solo** endeavors, and he'd learned he needed community, collaboration.

Teaching would put him in a **developmental** role, shaping minds and ethics. He could **counter** the cynicism in journalism with renewed purpose, be a **listener** to students' concerns while guiding them toward excellence. But academic **bureaucracy**—**politics** could be just as **brutal** as newsroom competition.

What if, as his father suggested, he didn't have to choose just one?

Alex started sketching a **projection**—a vision: Take the book deal but stay at The Metropolitan Voice **part-time**. Write the book over eighteen months. Then transition to teaching while maintaining a column. Build a **portfolio**—a **canvas** of work that included multiple forms of journalism, education, and authorship.

He texted Margaret: "What if I stayed at Metro Voice **part-time** while writing the book, then moved to **teaching** while keeping a monthly column?"

Her response was immediate: "**Happily** would support that. We don't want to lose you entirely. Part-time senior investigative reporter, monthly column, book leave—I can **pitch**—I can sell that to the board."

Alex felt a **blast** of relief. Not choosing between paths but weaving them together—that felt right. He could **strive** for multiple goals without sacrificing his **sanity**—**well-being**.

He called the National Voice editor who'd made the offer.

"I'm honored by the offer," Alex said honestly. "But I need to decline. I'm not ready for that **level**—that intensity of pressure yet. Maybe in five years, after I've had time to write my book and try teaching. But right now, I need a different path."

The editor was gracious in **disappointment**. "I understand. The door stays open. You've got **talent** and integrity—qualities we **desperately** need. When you're ready, call me."

Next, he called the publisher. "I want to accept the book deal, but I'd like to maintain part-time journalism work while writing. Is that feasible with your timeline?"

"Absolutely," the publisher said. "Take two years instead of one. We want the book to be excellent, not rushed. **Verify** your reporting, take your time. This is a **marathon**—a long project, not a sprint."

Finally, he called the journalism school. "I'm interested in the teaching position, but not until I've completed a book project. Could we revisit this in two years?"

"We'd love that," the program director said. "**Frankly**—**Honestly**, having you arrive with a published book would enhance the position. You'd be teaching from fresh experience, not just past accomplishments. Let's **stay**—let's keep in touch."

By late afternoon, Alex had crafted a path forward that felt both ambitious and sustainable. The **brutal** either-or choice had transformed into a both-and possibility. He wouldn't **inherit** just one identity—journalist or author or teacher—but could **strive** to be all three across time.

He walked **downtown** through the **autumn**—**fall** afternoon, past the **courtroom** where he'd covered trials, past the library where he'd researched investigations, past the **comic** book store where he'd **escape**—where he'd find escape on hard days. This city had been his **teacher**—his home for five years, and would continue to be, just with different rhythms.

His phone showed a text from Sophie in Riverside: "Heard you're writing a book! **So**—**Very** proud of you. When it's published, we're throwing you a proper hometown book party. No **fancy** city stuff—just **honest**—just real celebration."

The thought made him smile. A book party in Riverside, surrounded by people who'd known him before success, who'd **stamp**—who'd approve him based on character rather than achievement. That felt like the **ideal** measure of success.

At home, he made dinner—a habit now, not an exception—and thought about the **developmental** arc of his life. From small-town dreamer to struggling **rookie** to award-winning journalist to, now, someone crafting a more **complex**—**nuanced** career spanning multiple forms.

The **irony** of having worked so hard to escape Riverside only to make it central to his book wasn't lost on him. But **irony** and growth weren't mutually exclusive. You could leave home to find yourself, then return to fully understand what you'd left.

He opened his laptop and created a new document: "**Book Outline**: Heartland Voices—Bridging America's Divide Through Story." The **blank canvas** was both **intimidating**—**daunting** and exciting. He'd **spent**—he'd invested years gathering stories; now he'd **weave**—he'd craft them into something coherent, **compassion**ate, true.

As evening **descended**—as evening came, Alex felt at peace with his decision. Not because it was perfect, but because it was authentically his. Not driven by **ego** or **external**—**outside** pressure, but by genuine **appreciation** for the work itself.

The **projection** of his future had clarified: write the book, teach the next generation, continue investigating stories that mattered, maintain balance, stay connected to both Riverside and the city, be both journalist and human.

He thought about the journalism students he'd met, the ones who'd **inherit** the profession from his generation. They needed **mentor**s—**guides** who showed them journalism could be sustainable, that you didn't have to choose between excellence and **well-being**, that success had many forms.

Before bed, he wrote in his journal:

"Made my decision today. Or rather, made several decisions that together form a path forward. Taking the book deal, staying at Metro Voice part-time, planning to teach in two years. **It's**—This feels right—not because it's easy, but because it's **honest**—**true**.

"The **disappointment** I felt earlier this week about not having a **clear**—**simple** answer was really disappointment about **adult**—**grown-up** complexity. Turns out, maturity means accepting that good lives are rarely linear, that you can **strive** for multiple goals, that **choosing**—**decisions** can be both-and instead of either-or.

"I'm **excited**—**looking forward** to write this book. To **document**—**capture** the stories I've gathered, to try to bridge the **divide** I've witnessed. To use my **platform** not for **self-promotion**—not for **ego**, but for **service**—for **aid**.

"Whatever comes next—**success** or **struggle**, **ease** or **challenge**—at least I know I'm choosing it **consciously**—**intentionally**. Not letting others' **expectations** drive me, not following **propaganda** about what success should look like.

"**Just**—Simply building a life that **aligns**—that **matches** my values: **compassion**, **honesty**—**integrity**, **connection**, **balance**. That's the **throne** I want to sit on—not **power** or **prestige**, but **authenticity**—**truth**.

"**Here's**—This is to the next chapter. **Literally** and figuratively."

He closed the journal and looked at the framed **photo**—**picture** on his desk: him and his parents at his college graduation, all of them **squinting**—all of them smiling into the **sun**. They looked **proud** and **hopeful**, **unaware**—not knowing what challenges and triumphs would come.

If he could go back and tell that younger Alex anything, it would be: "The path won't be **straight**—**linear**. You'll **face**—**encounter** choices that **seem**—**appear** impossible. But trust yourself. **Strive** for **goodness**, not just greatness. **Value**—**Appreciate** the journey, not just the **destination**."

But he couldn't go back. He could only go forward, carrying the **lessons** learned, the **appreciation** gained, the **compassion** developed through **struggle** and **success** **alike**.

Tomorrow, he'd **start**—he'd begin outlining the book. But tonight, he'd **rest**, **secure**—**confident** in the knowledge that he'd **verified** his choice, that he'd chosen with both head and heart, that he'd honored both **ambition** and **humanity**.

The **solo** decisions of **youth**—the **solo** pursuit of **success** was giving way to something **richer**—**deeper**: a **life**—an **existence** woven with **connection**, **purpose**, and **authentic** **choice**.

And that, Alex realized, was the **ideal** **vision**—was the **true** **future** he'd been **seeking** all along.
