# Chapter 15: Job Interviews

**Tomorrow** arrived faster than Alex expected. After a week of sending applications and making connections, he finally had three **interview**s scheduled—his first real opportunities to break into journalism in the city. He woke up early, too nervous to **sleep** past six, despite having stayed up late preparing.

Standing before his small closet, Alex pulled out his only **good** suit jacket—a hand-me-down from his father that was slightly too large. He paired it with his **green** dress shirt and the most **original** tie he owned, one with a subtle pattern that didn't scream "small-town kid trying too hard." **Indeed**, he hoped he looked professional enough to be taken seriously.

Priya knocked on his door as he was adjusting his collar. "You **look** **good**," she said encouragingly. "Very professional. Want some breakfast? I made **cool** overnight oats—they'll give you energy without making you feel too full. Also, coffee is **necessary**—I know you need that to **operate**."

"Thanks," Alex said gratefully. He'd been too anxious to **think** about food, but she was right—he'd need energy to **perform** well today. He could **assume** these **interview**s would be challenging, so every **measure** of preparation **help**ed.

In the kitchen, Jin was already at the table reading the news on his tablet. "Big day, right? Where are the **interview**s?"

"First one's at a small nonprofit news outlet focused on environmental justice. Second is at a digital magazine covering local politics and culture. Third is at that news cooperative I mentioned—though that's less an **interview** and more a pitch session for a story **idea**. They're scattered across the city, so I'll be **leg**ging it between them all day."

"Sounds exhausting," Jin said. "My **research** **association** sometimes does hiring **operation**s like that—back-to-back **interview**s to **measure** how **candidate**s hold up under pressure."

"**Improve** your chances by being yourself," Jin advised. "Don't try to be who you **think** they **want**. The **best** journalists have **particular** voices and perspectives. That's what makes them valuable."

Alex appreciated the advice, though his nerves made it hard to fully absorb. He finished breakfast **quickly** and **head**ed out, giving himself extra **time** to account for any subway delays.

The first **interview** was at an office in a converted warehouse in Brooklyn. Alex arrived fifteen minutes early, as his **speech** teacher had always recommended. The reception area was minimal—just a desk, some chairs, and walls covered with framed articles about climate change, pollution, and environmental activism.

"Alex Morgan?" A woman in her forties appeared from a back office. She wore jeans and a blazer, her **hair** pulled back in a practical ponytail. "I'm Diana Reeves, managing editor. Come on back."

Her office was small but organized, with **stock** photos of protests and natural landscapes on the walls. One showed a **bar** graph tracking **cancer** rates near industrial sites. She gestured for Alex to **sit** while she settled behind her desk.

"So, Alex, tell me why you **want** to work in environmental journalism. I **assume** you have passion for the topic, but I **need** to understand how that passion would **relate** to our mission."

This was a question he'd prepared for, yet suddenly his carefully rehearsed answer felt **cold** and calculated. **Instead**, he went with honesty. "Growing up in Riverside, I saw how environmental issues **affect** real people's lives—factory pollution in the river, farms struggling with **climate** change, communities fighting to protect natural spaces. But those stories often don't get **told** unless they fit some big **national** narrative. I **want** to **tell** the local stories, the ones that **matter** to **actual** people but get ignored by major **media**."

Diana nodded, making notes. "**Good** answer. But I **need** to be honest with you—this position is entry-level, **which** means the pay is barely above minimum wage. We're a nonprofit, funded by donations and grants. We can't **offer** you the salary a **corporate** outlet could. Why should we **hire** you when we could **find** someone with more experience willing to **work** for the same **low** pay?"

The **kind** of **direct** question that would have rattled him a week ago, but Alex had learned **something** from the city already: honesty was currency. "You shouldn't, unless you value hunger and commitment over experience. I don't have years of clips or a **network** of sources yet. But I **will** **work** harder than anyone because I'm building **everything** from scratch. I'll **take** the stories no one else wants. I'll **learn** faster because I have to."

Diana's expression softened slightly. "Where did you go to school?"

"State university. Midwest. Not prestigious, but I **learn**ed the fundamentals. I **also** **write** a weekly **column** for the student **paper**, covered local **government** meetings, did investigative work on campus spending. I even **debate**d with a **lawyer** once about public records **access**—and won."

"**Reveal** something you learned from that work."

"That most **important** stories don't start with a **single** **dramatic** event. They start with someone noticing a pattern—small **budget** increases **here**, **missing** documents **there**. The **skill** is patience and attention to **detail**. You need to **measure** evidence carefully, **contain** your assumptions until you have facts."

They talked for another twenty minutes. Diana asked about his understanding of **environmental** policy, his thoughts on the **relationship** between **journalism** and activism, his willingness to **work** long **hour**s for little **money**. She asked about covering **religious** communities' environmental **work**, how to **trade** objectivity with advocacy, whether journalists were **agent**s of change or just observers. She asked **tough** questions that forced him to **reveal** his **thinking**, his values, his **approach** to ethical dilemmas. She even asked about his personal life—**marriage** plans, **family** commitments—things that might **affect** his **work** availability, though he knew such questions were legally questionable.

"We'll be making a **decision** next week," Diana said finally. "We have several other **candidate**s to **interview**. But I'll be honest—you did better than I expected. You're raw, but you're **genuine**. That **count**s for something."

"Thank you for the opportunity," Alex said, shaking her hand.

Walking out, he felt both exhilarated and exhausted. One **interview** down, two to go.

Walking to the second **interview**, Alex passed a **gas** station and stopped at a corner **bar** to use the restroom and collect himself. The second **interview** was in Manhattan, a completely different **environment**. The magazine's office occupied a floor in a modern building with **glass** walls and sleek furniture. Everything screamed "successful media company," though Alex knew from his **research** that they **also** struggled financially like most journalism outlets.

The editor, Marcus Chen—a different Marcus from the one back home—was younger than Diana, probably early thirties. He wore a **designer** shirt and had the **energy** of someone who drank too much coffee and slept too little. His desk was cluttered with **item**s—notebooks, press releases, **advance** copies of books.

"Alex, right? **Cool**. **Sit** down. So I looked at your portfolio. It's fine—**nothing** **amazing**, but solid **basic** work. Tell me what you **know** about us. And don't just recite what's on our **about** page—I want to **know** if you actually **read** our **content**."

Alex launched into what he'd **prepare**d—the magazine's focus on **local** **culture** and politics, their **particular** **strength** in covering **immigrant** communities and **urban** development, their recent **award** for a series on housing discrimination. "I **particular**ly liked your piece on landlord-tenant **management** issues and how vulnerable people become **victim**s of unfair practices," he added.

"**Good**, you did your homework. Now here's the **real** question: why should I **hire** some kid from—where was it, Riverside?—when I have **graduate**s from Columbia and NYU **willing** to **work** for **credit** alone?"

There was that challenge again, but **different** from Diana's. Marcus's **version** was more aggressive, testing whether Alex would **defend** himself or **fold** under pressure.

"Because I can **write** stories those **graduate**s can't," Alex said. "They **know** **theory** and **technique**, **which** is **important**. But I **know** what it's **like** to be an outsider trying to understand a **new** **world**. Half your **audience** is people **like** me—from somewhere else, trying to make sense of this city. I can speak to them in a **way** that feels **authentic** because I'm living it right now."

Marcus **lean**ed back in his chair, studying Alex. "Interesting **angle**. But can you handle the **pace**? We **produce** **content** constantly—daily articles, weekly features, social **media** across **multiple** platforms. It's not like writing a weekly **column** for a college **paper**."

"I understand the **pressure**. And I'm **prepare**d to **learn** on the job. I'm a fast **writer** and I **take** direction well."

They discussed **specific** **type**s of stories Alex might cover, his **understanding** of **different** **media** formats, his **social** **media** presence. Marcus asked him to pitch three story **idea**s on the **spot**—a test of **whether** he could **think** **quickly** and identify **interesting** **angle**s.

Alex pitched: a profile of **small** business owners adapting to **economic** changes in their neighborhoods; an investigation of how **local** **government** contracts were awarded; and a **piece** about **young** **professional**s navigating the city's **social** scene while building **career**s.

"Not bad," Marcus admitted. "The first two are decent. The third is **weak**—too **soft**, not enough **substance**. But I can **work** with this. **Here**'s the **deal**: I can't **offer** you a **full**-time position right now. Our **management** just froze new hires. But I can bring you on as a **regular** **contributor**—five pieces a month, paid per **article**. You do well, we might **move** you to **staff** in a few months. **Interested**?"

"Definitely," Alex said, trying not to **sound** too **eager** despite his **excitement**.

"Great. I'll send you a **contract** to **review**. **Also**, heads **up**—we **expect** **high** standards. If your work isn't **good**, we won't **use** it, and we won't pay for it. **Fair**?"

"Fair."

Walking out of that **interview**, Alex felt **different** than after the first. Diana had seemed **interested** in his **character** and commitment. Marcus seemed **interested** in his utility—what value could he **produce** for the magazine. Both approaches were valid, he supposed, just different **type**s of **relationship**s. His **leg** was starting to ache from all the walking, and he realized he hadn't eaten **since** breakfast. He grabbed a **quick** sandwich, noting every **dollar** spent as his budget couldn't **handle** much waste.

The third meeting was that evening at the news cooperative. When Alex arrived, he found a dozen people gathered around a long **table**, reviewing **article**s on laptops and discussing coverage **plan**s.

"You must be Alex," said a woman who introduced herself as Sarah. "Welcome. We're just finishing **review**ing this week's pieces. Grab a **seat** and we'll get to **new** pitches in a minute."

Alex sat and observed. The group had an egalitarian **energy**—everyone seemed to have equal voice, and decisions were made through **discussion** and **consensus** rather than top-down **authority**. It reminded him of the **democratic** **organization**s he'd **read** about in his political science classes.

When it was **time** for **new** pitches, Sarah turned to him. "Alex, you said you had a story **idea**?"

He'd been **think**ing about this since his encounter with the Neighborhood Justice Coalition. "I want to write about tenant organizing in Brooklyn. There's a group fighting gentrification and displacement—the **kind** of **story** that affects thousands of **people** but doesn't get much **attention** from mainstream **media** because it's seen as too **local** or too political."

"What's your **angle**?" another member asked. "Just describing their **work** isn't enough. We **need** something that **reveal**s a larger **truth** or **connect**s to broader **issue**s."

"The **angle** is how **ordinary** people are doing the **work** that government should be doing—protecting their communities, ensuring **justice**, creating **safe** **space**s. It's about democracy from the **bottom** **up** rather than the **top** down. They're **beat**ing back displacement through grassroots **operation**s."

The group discussed his **idea**, asking questions about his **access** to the **organization**, his **plan** for **research**, how he'd **address** potential **bias** since he was clearly sympathetic to their cause. One member asked how he'd **measure** success and what **item**s he'd focus on in his reporting.

"I **think** it could **work**," Sarah said finally. "But we'd **want** to see a **first** **draft** before we commit to **production**. Can you have something to us in two weeks?"

"Absolutely."

"Great. One more thing—we operate on a **stock** rate of two hundred **dollar**s per **article**. It's not much, but we're a cooperative, so as **production** increases and **revenue** grows, everyone **benefit**s equally. We're also working toward offering **health** insurance to **regular** **contributor**s—hopefully by next year."

Two hundred **dollar**s for an **article** wasn't much, but it was something. And more importantly, it was an opportunity to do the **kind** of journalism he believed in.

Walking home that night, Alex's **head** spun with everything that had happened. Three **interview**s in one day, each **reveal**ing different **aspect**s of the journalism landscape. Different **economic** models, different editorial **approach**es, different **relationship**s between **writer**s and **publication**s.

His phone buzzed—a text from his mother: "How did the **interview**s go? We're thinking about you. Love, Mom and Dad."

He called instead of texting, needing to **hear** familiar voices.

"They went well, I **think**," he told them. "One might lead to **regular** freelance work. One offered a **contributor** position. The third wants to see a draft of a story before deciding."

"That's wonderful!" his mother said. "Which one do you **want**?"

"Honestly? All of them. I don't **think** I'm in a position to be picky. I **need** to prove myself, build a **portfolio**, establish my **name**."

"Just **remember** to **take** care of yourself," his father added, having picked **up** the extension. "Don't **work** yourself to **death** trying to succeed all at once."

"I'll try to **balance** it," Alex promised.

After hanging **up**, he sat in his room thinking about what came next. If all three opportunities **work**ed out, he'd be juggling **multiple** **assignment**s while still searching for more **stable** **employment**. The **weight** of it felt **heavy**, but **also** **exciting**.

Priya knocked and **enter**ed with two **glass**es of wine. "Celebratory drink? Jin told me you survived three **interview**s in one day. That **deserve**s recognition."

They sat together, and Alex **share**d **detail**s of his day. Priya listened carefully, asking **good** questions.

"The cooperative **sound**s **like** the **best** fit for you **value**-wise," she observed. "But the magazine might **offer** more **exposure** and **money**. And the nonprofit **align**s with your **interest**s in **social** **issue**s."

"So what do I do?"

"Why not try to do all three? See what **work**s, what you're **good** at, where you fit **best**. You're **young**—this is the **time** to experiment, to **figure** out your **place** in the **field**."

"That's **kind** of terrifying."

"**Welcome** to **adult**hood," Priya said with a **smile**. "It's all terrifying. But **also** **amazing** if you let it be."

Later, alone again, Alex opened his laptop and started writing. Not for any **specific** **assignment**, but just to process his thoughts. He wrote about the **difference**s between the three **interview**s, what each **reveal**ed about the **state** of journalism, about **economic** pressures and editorial **value**s and the **relationship** between **writer**s and **audience**s.

The **production** of **content** had always come easily to him—the **skill** was in the doing, in translating observations into **word**s that **connect**ed with **reader**s. But now he was beginning to understand the **business** **side** too, the **complex** **economic** and organizational structures that determined what got **publish**ed and **read**.

As midnight approached, Alex felt both **tired** and **energize**d. The **interview**s had been a **trial**, a **test** of whether he belonged in this **world**. He didn't **know** yet if he'd **pass**ed, but he knew he'd given **honest** **answer**s, **present**ed himself **authentic**ally, and **demonstrate**d genuine **interest** in doing **meaningful** **work**.

**Tomorrow** he'd **wake** **up** and continue the **process**—sending more **application**s, following **up** on connections, working on the **article** for the cooperative. But tonight, he allowed himself to feel proud. He'd faced the **challenge** and hadn't **fold**ed. He'd **speak**n his **truth** and **defend**ed his **worth**.

The city outside his window **glow**ed with **light** and **life**, indifferent to his **small** **victory**. But it was his **victory** nonetheless—one **step** forward in a journey that had **none** of the **guarantee**s he might have **wish**ed for, but all the **possibility** he'd **dream**ed about.

As he finally **climb**ed into **bed**, Alex's last thought was about the **middle** ground he was **learn**ing to **navigate**—between **confidence** and **humility**, between **ambition** and **patience**, between the **person** he was and the journalist he was becoming.

It was a **deep** **place** to be, **neither** fully **arrive**d nor still **start**ing out. But it was exactly where he **need**ed to be.

And that, for now, was enough.
