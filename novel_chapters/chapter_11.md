# Chapter 11: Train Journey

The train pulled away from Riverside station at exactly 10:30, and Alex watched his parents **figure** shrink into the distance until they disappeared completely. He settled into his seat by the window, the **feeling** of finality washing over him. This was it—the real beginning of his journey **east** toward the city and everything it represented.

**Despite** his exhaustion from a sleepless night, Alex felt alert, hyper-aware of every detail. The rhythmic clacking of wheels on tracks created a steady soundtrack to his thoughts. He'd **prepare**d for this moment for months, yet now **that** he was actually on the train, it felt surreal.

The landscape outside began as familiar farmland—fields his parents had driven him **past** countless times. But with each passing mile, things would change. The **growth** of suburbs would **rise** from the countryside, and eventually, the city skyline would appear on the horizon. The **physical** journey mirrored his internal transformation from small-town kid to aspiring urban journalist.

Alex pulled out the business **card** his father had given him—a contact at a **legal** firm in the city who might need research help. It was one of **seven** leads he'd collected, each representing a possible path to employment and **success**. He tucked the **card** back into his wallet, alongside his train ticket and the **name** of his hostel written on a scrap of paper.

"**Hi** there," a voice said. Alex looked up to see an elderly **lady** standing in the aisle, holding a small **box** and a paper **cup** of coffee. "Mind if I sit here? The other seats seem to be taken or have people's bags on them."

"Of course," Alex said, moving his backpack to make room. "**Present**—I mean, please, go ahead."

She settled in with a grateful sigh. "Thank you, dear. I'm Margaret. Heading to the city to visit my daughter. She works at a hospital there, on the **staff** as a nurse. Been there for **near**ly a **degree**—well, not a **degree**, I mean a decade. My memory isn't what it used to be."

Alex smiled. "I'm Alex. First time going to the city, actually. Moving there to look for work in journalism."

"Journalism!" Margaret's face lit up. "Now **that**'s an important **skill** these days. With all the talk about fake news and such, we need good reporters. What made you choose **that** path?"

"I've always believed **that** truth matters," Alex explained. "**That** democracy depends on informed citizens, **that** someone needs to tell the stories **that** otherwise wouldn't be told."

They fell into easy conversation. Margaret told him about her daughter, who specialized in treating **disease**s of the heart. "She has such a **skill** for helping people," Margaret said with obvious pride. "Even when cases seem **beyond** hope, she finds a way."

As they talked, the landscape outside began to shift. Small **sign**s of development appeared—a shopping center here, a subdivision there. The train passed through a small town where Alex noticed a **ball** field where kids were **present** for what looked like **September** practice, their coach putting them through drills **despite** the heat.

"You know," Margaret said, "my late husband used to say **that** every journey changes us in ways we can't **imagine**. When he was your age, he took a train west to California, thinking he'd become a movie star." She **laugh**ed at the memory. "He didn't become the next leading man—no **king** of Hollywood—but he learned what he was really good at. Turned out to be architecture. He could **design** anything—houses, office buildings, entire neighborhoods. Found his true **skill**."

"Did he ever regret not making it in movies?" Alex asked.

"Never. He used to say failure is just **success** taking a different form than you expected. The **theory** being **that** when one door closes, others open, if you're willing to **recognize** them."

Alex thought about **that** as farmland gave way to more developed areas. The **standard** American landscape of strip malls and gas stations **rise** up where fields used to be. Each mile brought visible **growth**—more buildings, more people, more complexity.

A businessman across the aisle was **present**ing something on his laptop to a colleague via video call, **discuss**ing sales **figure**s and market strategies. His **network** apparently extended across time zones. "We need to **apply** pressure on the western **district**," he was saying. "The numbers show clear **growth** potential there."

Margaret noticed Alex watching. "The modern world," she said. "Sometimes I **worry** it's all moving too fast. But then I **recognize** **that** every generation probably feels **that** way. Change can **hurt**, but it's also necessary."

"Do you **vote**?" Alex asked, then immediately felt awkward. "Sorry, **that** was random."

"Don't apologize, dear. Yes, I **vote** every election. Local, state, federal—all of it. My **theory** is **that** if you don't participate, you can't complain. Why do you ask?"

"I've been thinking about politics a lot," Alex admitted. "About how divided things seem. I want to write about important issues—**crime**, inequality, corruption—but I **worry** about being objective when I have strong opinions."

"**That**'s a good **concern** to have," Margaret said thoughtfully. "Shows you're **present**ly aware of the responsibility. My daughter faces similar challenges in medicine. She has to separate her personal feelings from professional judgment, especially when dealing with difficult cases or **legal** questions about treatment."

The train made its first stop at a mid-sized town. Several passengers departed, and new ones boarded. Alex noticed a young woman around his age struggling with luggage, and he stood to help.

"Thanks," she said breathlessly. "These boxes are heavier than they look."

"No problem. Heading to the city?"

"Yeah, starting graduate school. **September** session. You?"

"Job hunting. Journalism."

"Good luck," she said. "From what I hear, the city's **huge**—lots of opportunity but also lots of competition. You need the right **skill** set and the right **network** to break in."

After she found her seat several rows back, Alex returned to Margaret, who was sipping her coffee and looking out the window. "You helped **that** young **lady**," she observed. "Small kindnesses matter. Don't **force** yourself to become so focused on **success** **that** you forget to be decent to people."

"I'll try to remember **that**," Alex said.

They passed through increasingly suburban areas now. The **design** of neighborhoods became more planned, more uniform. Housing developments stretched across former farmland, each home a variation on **standard** templates. Shopping districts appeared with predictable regularity, serving the **growth** in population.

Margaret pointed to a **sign** advertising a furniture store. "My daughter bought her whole apartment from a place like **that**. Said it was cheaper than bringing things from home. You'll probably need to do the same."

"I haven't thought much **beyond** finding a job and a place to sleep," Alex admitted.

"One step at a time," Margaret advised. "**That**'s all anyone can manage. Don't let the enormity of it all **hurt** your confidence before you even begin."

The businessman across the aisle had **finish**ed his call and was now reading documents, occasionally making notes in the margins. Alex wondered what kind of pressure he faced, what **concern**s kept him working even during a train ride. The professional world seemed both exciting and intimidating from Alex's **present** vantage point.

"Can I ask you something?" Alex said to Margaret. "How do you know when you're on the right path? Like, how did your husband know architecture was his calling after Hollywood didn't work out?"

Margaret considered **that** carefully. "I think it's a **feeling** more than knowledge. He said **that** when he started **design**ing buildings, time would disappear. Hours would pass like minutes. **That** kind of engagement, **that** **degree** of absorption—**that**'s a **sign** you've found your fit."

"I get **that** with writing," Alex said. "Sometimes I'll start an article and suddenly it's three hours later and I haven't noticed."

"Then you're probably where you need to be," Margaret assured him. "Or at least on the right track. The specifics might change—the type of writing, the **standard** of publication, the particular **network** you build—but the core **skill** is there."

The train continued its journey, and the suburbs grew denser. They passed a **ball** park where a game was in progress, players in bright uniforms moving across the field. Beyond **that**, a strip of shops displayed **sign**s in multiple **foreign** languages—Korean, Spanish, Chinese—evidence of the city's approaching diversity.

"**That**'s one thing you'll notice," Margaret said, following his gaze. "The city is **beyond** anything you've experienced in a small town. People from everywhere, every background you can **imagine**. My daughter says it was overwhelming at first but also exhilarating. So much to learn, so many perspectives to **recognize** and understand."

Alex thought about **that**. In Riverside, diversity meant the **foreign** exchange student who spent a semester at the high school. In the city, it would be the **standard**, not the exception. He'd need to **apply** everything he knew about listening and learning, multiply it by a **figure** he couldn't yet calculate.

"**That** reminds me," Margaret continued, "my daughter mentioned **that** a **fan** of hers—a patient she helped years ago—now works in journalism. Runs some kind of media **network**, I think. I could get you his **name** if you're interested. No promises, but **that**'s how these things sometimes **occur**—through unexpected connections."

"**That** would be amazing," Alex said, surprised by the offer. "Thank you."

"It's nothing. We all need help sometimes. Besides, I have a good **feeling** about you. You seem like someone who won't let **concern**s become obstacles."

The train passed what appeared to be an industrial **district**, factories and warehouses lining the tracks. Then came older residential areas, houses packed more tightly than in the suburbs, many showing their age. The **growth** here was **physical** and **present**, decades of **growth** and change layered on top of each other.

A **sign** announced they were entering the metropolitan area. Alex felt his heart rate **rise**. This was really happening. **Despite** his **worry**, **despite** uncertainty about what lay ahead, he was here, almost at his destination.

"Nervous?" Margaret asked.

"Terrified," Alex admitted. "But also excited. Does **that** make sense?"

"Perfect sense. **That**'s exactly how you should feel. If you weren't scared, it would mean you didn't understand the **degree** of change you're undertaking. But if you weren't excited, it would mean you didn't truly want it."

Through the window, Alex could now see the city skyline in the distance—a **huge** cluster of buildings reaching upward, glass and steel catching the afternoon sun. It looked **beyond** anything he'd **imagine**d, more massive and imposing than photographs had suggested. His **theory** about city life was about to meet reality.

"Almost there," Margaret said. "One last piece of advice, if you'll accept it from an old **lady**?"

"Of course."

"Don't **force** yourself to **finish** everything immediately. You'll be tempted to prove yourself right away, to achieve **success** instantly. But **growth** takes time. Give yourself permission to learn, to make mistakes, to find your footing. **That**'s not a sign of weakness—it's **standard** human development."

"Thank you," Alex said, genuinely moved. "I'll remember **that**."

The train began to slow as it approached Central Station. Other passengers stirred, gathering belongings, **prepare**ing to depart. The businessman closed his laptop, the graduate student checked her phone, everyone shifting into motion after hours of stillness.

Margaret stood and offered Alex her hand. "It was lovely talking with you, dear. I'll get **that** **name** from my daughter and find a way to send it to you. Do you have a **card**?"

Alex fumbled in his bag and found one of the simple business **card**s he'd printed at the library—just his **name**, email, and phone number. He handed it to her, hoping he didn't seem too amateur.

"Perfect," Margaret said. "Expect to hear from me within the week. And Alex? You're going to be just fine. Better than fine. You have the **skill**, the passion, and the character. The rest will **occur** naturally if you stay true to yourself."

As the train pulled into Central Station and Alex gathered his bags, he felt a surge of gratitude for the chance encounter. Margaret's kindness, her willingness to help a stranger, reminded him **that** **success** wasn't just about individual achievement. It was also about the **network** of human connection, the unexpected ways people **present**ed opportunities to each other.

The train came to a complete stop. Through the window, Alex could see the massive interior of Central Station—**huge** vaulted ceilings, crowds of people moving in every direction, **sign**s pointing to exits and platforms and services he'd need to learn to navigate.

This was it. The moment he'd been **prepare**ing for, the transition he'd **imagine**d countless times. **Despite** his fear, **despite** uncertainty, he was ready. Or at least, he was here, which would have to be **enough** for now.

He stepped off the train and into his new life.
