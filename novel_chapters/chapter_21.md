# Chapter 21: The Newsroom

The glass doors of The Metropolitan Voice building didn't **like** any doors Alex had seen in Riverside. They slid open automatically with a soft whoosh, **like** something from a science fiction movie. He stepped **inside**, clutching his leather portfolio—a **gift** from his parents before he left home—and felt his heart **turn** in his chest.

"**Huh**," he whispered to himself, taking in the vast open floor plan before him. The newsroom was nothing **like** he'd imagined. Instead of the ordered rows of desks he'd seen in old journalism movies, this space was a **wonderful** chaos of **labor** and creativity.

Glass-walled offices ringed the perimeter **like** clear **block**s of transparency, while the center of the room sprawled with clusters of desks where reporters hunched over keyboards. Massive screens displayed live news feeds and social media analytics. Someone had tacked up a handwritten note that read, "**Refuse** to accept easy answers." Alex **smile**d, feeling his nervousness **turn** slightly toward excitement.

"You must be Alex Morgan," a voice said from his left.

He **turn**ed to see a woman in her forties approaching, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun. She wore glasses perched on her nose and carried a tablet under one arm and a half-eaten **apple** in her other hand.

"Sarah Chen," she said, extending her hand after quickly finishing the **apple** and tossing the core into a nearby recycling bin. "Welcome to the newsroom. I **encourage** quick thinking here—that **apple** was my breakfast and probably my lunch. Ready for your first day?"

"**Definitely**," Alex said, shaking her hand firmly, hoping he sounded more confident than he felt. "Thank you for this opportunity. I'm **sure** I can—"

"Don't thank me yet," Sarah interrupted with a knowing **smile**. "Let me **introduce** you to the team, and then we'll discuss your assignment."

As they walked through the newsroom, Sarah explained the layout. "The digital team sits in the **middle** here—they handle our website, social media, and **blog** content. We've seen a significant **increase** in our online readership, which is where most of our **sales** and ad revenue come from now."

Alex noticed the **additional** screens everywhere, displaying real-time analytics, trending topics, and breaking news alerts. This was a far cry from the dusty archives and printing presses he'd romanticized. The modern newsroom was **involved** with technology at every **turn**.

"That's Marcus in the corner," Sarah pointed to a young Black reporter typing furiously. "He covers **neighborhood** stories, community organizing, that sort of thing. You'll be working closely with him." She **turn**ed to face Alex directly. "Which brings me to your **contract** and what we **express**ly need from you."

They entered her glass-walled office, and Sarah gestured for Alex to sit. Through the transparent walls, Alex could see the newsroom continuing its productive hum. It struck him that there were no **prison**-**like** walls here, no **hole**s to hide in. Everything was visible, collaborative.

"Let me **express** something clearly," Sarah began, leaning forward. "This isn't going to be what you imagined. No glamorous assignments right away, no breaking national stories. You'll **conduct** interviews with local business owners, cover **garden** festivals, write about **species** of **bird**s migrating through the city **lake**s. Community stuff. Does that **matter** to you?"

"It does," Alex said, and he **express**ed it with genuine **belief**. "I think those stories **matter** more than people realize. They're about real people's lives."

Sarah's **smile** widened with approval. "Good answer. I had my doubts, honestly. Young reporters from small towns either romanticize journalism **like** it's some kind of holy calling—'**oh**, I'm going to change the **world**'—or they treat it **like** a stepping **stone** to something bigger. Which **one** are you?"

Alex considered his **path** carefully before responding. "I **believe** journalism serves a purpose. Maybe that sounds **like** I think I'm on some mission from **God**, but I don't **mean** it that way. I just think if you're going to **earn** people's trust, you have to actually care about their stories."

"Interesting," Sarah said, tapping something into her tablet. "Let me give you some **understanding** of how we **conduct** ourselves here. We **refuse** to publish anything we can't verify. We don't **blow** things out of proportion for clicks, even though our **sales** team would **like** us to. And we don't treat our sources **like** **object**s to mine for quotes. They're **human** **being**s with **real** lives. Understand?"

"**Sure**," Alex said, nodding.

"Your first assignment," Sarah continued, pulling up something on her tablet, "is to cover a **debt** relief workshop happening in the Westside **neighborhood**. Local churches—**Christian** organizations **mostly**—are running financial literacy programs to help families **concerned** about predatory lending. I want you to **attempt** a feature that shows both the problem and the community's response."

Alex pulled out his notebook, scribbling notes. "How long do I have?"

"Your **complete** draft needs to be **inside** my inbox by Thursday. That gives you three days to **conduct** interviews, gather background, and write it up. The workshop is tomorrow afternoon at the community **library**."

"I'll be there," Alex promised.

Sarah studied him for a moment, then stood. "**One** more thing. See that woman **over** there?" She pointed through the glass wall to a **reporter** with silver hair sitting near the windows. "That's Diana Rodriguez. She's been doing this for thirty years. If she offers you **advice**, take **it**. If she invites you to **lunch**, go. She doesn't waste time on **people** who aren't **serious**."

As they **return**ed to the main floor, Sarah **introduce**d Alex to several team members. Marcus looked up from his keyboard with a friendly **wave** and mouthed, "**Welcome**." A young woman named Keisha, who ran the **newspaper**'s social media accounts, **smile**d and called out, "Fresh **blood**! Hope you **survive** your first **week**!"

Sarah showed Alex to his desk—a small space near Marcus, with a desktop computer, a phone, and **very** little else. "This is your starting point," she said. "We don't have fancy perks or **fund**s to **spend** on making the office **look** **like** a tech startup. We spend our money on reporting. Your salary isn't going to **make** you **rich**, and we can't promise you'll **earn** **fame**, but if you **work** **hard** and **really** care about getting stories **right**, you'll learn more here than anywhere else." She handed him a sticky note with login credentials. "Your password **code** is on here. Change it once you're in."

After Sarah **left**, Alex sat down slowly, running his hand along the desk's surface. He logged into his computer, discovering his email already set up and a **draft** **file** with the **newspaper**'s style **guide** waiting for him. There was also a message from Marcus: "**Hey**! **Need** **help** finding the **library** tomorrow? Happy to **show** you the way—it's my **neighborhood**. Also, **there**'s a **great** taco **place** on that **block** we **should** hit for **lunch** sometime. **Welcome** to the team!"

Alex typed a quick **reply**: "Thanks! I'd **appreciate** the help tomorrow. And **definitely** interested in those tacos."

He spent the rest of the morning reading through previous stories about the Westside **neighborhood**, trying to understand the **context** for his assignment. The area had been hit **hard** by the **recession**—**many** families struggling with **debt**, foreclosures, unemployment. The financial literacy workshop was one **attempt** to **address** these **problem**s at the community level. He bookmarked a **sample** article from last year about a similar program that had helped families avoid foreclosure.

Diana Rodriguez appeared at his desk around noon, holding two cups of **coffee**. "You're the **new** **one**," she stated rather than asked, setting one cup in front of him. "**Drink** this. You **look** **like** you **need** **it**."

"Thank you," Alex said, accepting the **gift** gratefully.

"Sarah **give** you the Westside **debt** workshop?"

"Yes, ma'am."

Diana **smile**d slightly. "**Never** **call** me ma'am. Makes me **feel** **old**. **Call** me Diana." She perched on the edge of his desk. "That **neighborhood** is important. Good people there—hardworking, **concerned** about their **families**, trying to **make** **something** of their lives despite everything working against them. Don't **conduct** your interviews **like** you're some outside observer. **Really** **listen**. Get **inside** their **world**. That's where the **real** story is."

"I will," Alex promised.

"And **one** more thing," Diana **add**ed, her **expression** **turn**ing more **serious**. "**When** you **write** about people facing **hard** times—**debt**, poverty, whatever—**never** **make** them **feel** **small**. They're **not** **object**s of pity. They're **people** dealing with **real** **problem**s in a **broken** **system**. Your **job** is to **show** that with dignity. And always fact-check—a single error can **fire** up critics who want to discredit everything we do."

**After** Diana **left**, Alex sat **back** in his chair, letting her **advice** sink in. He **look**ed around the newsroom—the **constant** motion, the **flow** of information, the **sense** of purpose that seemed to **fill** every corner. This wasn't **just** a **job** for these people. **It** was a calling, a **belief** in the power of **truth** and the importance of bearing witness to **real** lives.

His phone buzzed—a **text** from his **mother**: "How's your first day, sweetheart? We're **think**ing about you. Your **father** **say**s to **work** **hard** and **remember** where you **come** from. **Love** you."

Alex **smile**d and **type**d **back**: "**It**'s going **well**. Missing you both. This **place** is nothing **like** Riverside, but I **think** I'm going to **like** **it** here."

And as he hit send, watching the message **roll** away into the digital **space** between him and home, Alex realized he **mean**t **it**. This was where his **path** had **lead** him—this newsroom, this **neighborhood** he'd soon explore, these stories waiting to be **tell**. The afternoon **light** slanted through the windows, casting long shadows across his desk, and Alex Morgan **open**ed a **new** **file** to **begin** his research.

He had a **complete** understanding now: this was **only** the beginning. The **work** would be **hard**, the **life** uncertain, but he was ready to **earn** his **place** here, one story at a time.

The newsroom continued its productive noise around him—keyboards clicking, phones ringing, conversations **flow**ing between desks. Sarah caught his eye through her glass wall and **give** him an encouraging nod. Marcus **call**ed **over**: "**Hey**, Alex! **Want** to grab **lunch** later? I'll **fill** you in on the **neighborhood** politics."

"**Sure**," Alex **call**ed **back**, his **smile** genuine now, his nervousness finally beginning to fade.

This was **it**. This was **real**. This was **work** that **matter**ed.

And Alex was **sure** he was exactly where he **belong**ed.
