# Chapter 29: Workplace Mistakes

The email arrived at 7:43 AM, before Alex had even finished his coffee. The subject line made his stomach drop: "**Correction** Needed - Westside Community Garden Story."

"**Ah**, shit," Alex muttered, opening the message. It was from Robert Chen, the copy editor, with Sarah CC'd.

"Alex, your **feature** story from yesterday contains an error. You state that the community **garden** was established in 2017. According to **historical** records and my own **reference** check with the Parks Department, it was actually established in 2016. This may seem **slightly** trivial, but dates are facts, and we must **correct** them. Please prepare a **correction** notice immediately."

Alex's hands trembled **slightly** as he reread the message. He'd been so careful, or so he thought. He pulled up his notes, **search**ing for where he'd gotten the date. There it was—a **quote** from one of the **garden** members saying "we've been here about seven years." Alex had calculated from 2024 back to 2017, but the **garden** had actually opened in late 2016. The member had been approximating, and Alex had failed to **verify** with official records. His **attempt** at calculation had been his undoing—he should have sought to **obtain** the actual founding documents.

The **consequence**s **emerge**d quickly. Sarah called him into her office before nine o'clock. Her **expression** was serious, disappointed.

"Sit **down**," she said. "I assume you saw Robert's email?"

"Yes. I'm so sorry. I should have checked the official date instead of **rely**ing on someone's estimate."

"Yes, you **should** have. This is exactly the kind of error that gives critics ammunition to **attack** our credibility. One person on Twitter is already using this to **judge** the **accuracy** of your entire Jasmine **feature** from last **week**. 'If he can't get a simple date **right**, what else did he get wrong?' That's the **conclusion** people **jump** to. This requires a **broad** **assessment** of your fact-checking process."

Alex felt the **bottom** fall out of his confidence. The Jasmine story had been his breakthrough, the piece where he'd found his voice. Now it was being used as **evidence** of his **careless**ness.

"I take full **responsibility**," Alex said. "What do I **need** to do?"

"First, we **publish** a **correction** in tomorrow's edition and on the website. Second, you call the **garden** **organize**rs and apologize for the error. Third—and this is the **long**-term **consequence**—you **establish** a better verification process. Every fact, every date, every statistic **needs** a **reliable** **source**. No **exception**s."

"I understand."

"Do you?" Sarah leaned forward. "Because this isn't just about you. When you **make** an error, it reflects on the entire paper. It gives ammunition to people who want to dismiss journalism as 'fake news.' You **belong** to a **team**, and your mistakes **affect** us all. We're all in this together—we must **lift** each other up, not **drag** **ourselves** **down** with **careless** errors."

The **weight** of that hit Alex **hard**. He'd been thinking only of his own embarrassment, not the broader **consequence**s. "You're **right**. I'll do better."

After leaving Sarah's office, Alex sat at his desk, staring at his screen. Marcus appeared beside him, **extend**ing a cup of coffee.

"Heard about the error," Marcus said quietly. "We've all been there, man."

"**Really**?"

"**Oh** yeah. My first year, I misidentified someone in a photo caption. Wrong person entirely. Had to apologize to two different people—the one I wrongly identified and the one I failed to identify **correct**ly. It was humiliating. I felt my stomach **pound** with anxiety for days. The whole **affair** was a **surprise** because I'd been so confident."

"How did you **move** **past** it?"

"By **learn**ing the **lesson** and not repeating the mistake. Errors happen, Alex. The question is whether you **defend** them or own them, whether you learn or repeat."

Alex spent the **next** hour drafting the **correction** notice. It had to be **clear** but not overly apologetic—acknowledging the error without undermining **confidence** in the **story**'s other facts. He wrote:

"**Correction**: In yesterday's **feature** about the Westside Community Garden, we incorrectly stated the **garden** was established in 2017. The **correct** founding year was 2016. We **apologize** for the error and have updated the **online** version."

He sent it to Sarah for **approval**, then picked up the phone to call the **garden**'s main **organize**r. His hand **hover**ed over the phone for a moment. This was the **hard** part—facing the people he'd **fail**ed.

The call was **brief** but **awk**ward. The **organize**r, a woman named Patricia (the same Patricia from his earlier story), was gracious but **clear** about her disappointment. She mentioned she was **married** to one of the founding members who'd passed away **half** a year ago—getting the founding year wrong felt personal.

"We trusted you, Alex. Dates matter because they're part of our **history**. Getting it wrong, even by a year, **feel**s like you didn't **value** our story enough to check."

"You're absolutely **right**, and I **apologize**. It won't happen again."

"I **believe** you **mean** that. But **meaning** it and **do**ing the work to **ensure** it are different things."

After hanging up, Alex sat back in his chair. Patricia's words **cut** deeper than Sarah's **criticism** or Robert's email. The people he wrote about **deserve**d better. They **open**ed their lives to him, shared their struggles and **triumph**s, and he owed them **accuracy**.

Diana appeared at his desk around **lunch** time. "Walk with me," she said. It wasn't a request.

They left the building and walked toward a small park a few **block**s away. The autumn air was **cool**, leaves **fall**ing from trees. Diana didn't **speak** until they **reach**ed a **bench** overlooking a **pond**.

"First major error?" she asked.

"Yeah."

"How are you **handle**ing it?"

"Badly. I **feel** like I've **prove**n I'm not **good** enough for this."

Diana **smile**d **slightly**. "That's actually a **good** sign. The **report**ers who worry me are the ones who shrug off errors like they don't **matter**. You're taking **responsibility**, which **mean**s you have the **character** to improve."

"Sarah's disappointed in me."

"Of course she is. But disappointment isn't the same as giving up on you. If she'd given up, she wouldn't have **spend** time explaining the broader **consequence**s. She'd have just issued a **warning** and **move**d on."

"Patricia—the **garden** **organize**r—said **something** similar. That **meaning** well isn't enough. You have to do the work."

"She's **right**. **Intent**ion doesn't **equal** execution. But here's what I want you to understand: every **good** **journal**ist has a story about their first major error. **Mine** involved confusing two council members with similar names, writing that **one** had voted for a **regulation** he'd actually opposed. The **consequence**s **include**d him losing his **re-election** because my error made him look like he'd broken a campaign **promise**. Later won an **award** for investigative journalism, but I never forgot that early mistake."

"That's **terrible**."

"It was. And I **carry** that with me **every** time I write. It made me compulsive about verification. Every name, every **vote**, every fact—I check **twice**, sometimes three times. The error didn't **destroy** my **career**, but it **shape**d how I **approach** this work."

They sat in silence for a moment, watching ducks **swim** across the **pond**. Alex thought about the **pair**ed truths Diana was offering—that errors were **serious** but also survivable, that shame could transform into **discipline**.

"How do I **rebuild** people's **trust**?" Alex asked.

"By doing better work going forward. By establishing systems to **prevent** errors. By showing, not just **tell**ing, that you learned the **lesson**."

Back at the newsroom, Alex created a new **document** on his computer: "Verification Checklist." He listed every **category** of fact that **need**ed checking—dates, names, ages, addresses, statistics, **quote**s, **historical** **reference**s. Beside each **category**, he noted potential **source**s: official records, multiple human **source**s, **archive**s, **expert**s.

Marcus looked over his shoulder. "Building a **system**?"

"Yeah. I **need** to **ensure** this doesn't happen again."

"Mind if I **extend** a **suggestion**? Add a step where someone else **review**s your fact claims before **publish**ication. A **pair** of eyes catches things you **miss**."

Alex added it to the checklist. "Thanks."

"We **look** out for each other, man. Your success helps all of us, and your errors **affect** us **too**. Not saying that to make you **feel** **bad**—just stating the **real**ity of working on a **team**."

The **next** day, the **correction** **publish**ed both in print and as an **ad**-like box on the website. Alex **steel**ed himself for **online** **reaction**s, which **range**d from understanding ("everyone **make**s mistakes") to **harsh** ("typical media **careless**ness"). One comment stung particularly: "And these are the people asking us to **trust** them with important stories? This **demand**s better standards."

But there were also **defend**ers. Patricia, the **garden** **organize**r, posted on Facebook: "Alex Morgan made an error and corrected it promptly and with **genuine** **apology**. That's what **responsible** **journal**ism looks **like**. We're disappointed but not giving up on him."

Alex screenshot the post and saved it. Not as **excuse**, but as reminder—this was what accountability looked like. You **own**ed mistakes, you **correct**ed them, and you earned back **trust** through better work.

Over the following **week**s, Alex **implement**ed his new verification **system**. Every story took **slightly** longer, but the **quality** improved. He **double**-checked dates against official records. He **verify**ed **quote**s with **source**s. He asked colleagues to **review** his key facts before **submit**tion. The process became as **familiar** as **tie**ing a **tie** or putting on a **suit** for formal occasions—automatic through repetition.

Robert Chen noticed. "Your last three stories have been **clean**," he said in passing one day. Not **warm** praise, but from Robert, it was significant.

Sarah **notice**d **too**. "I can see you've **adjust**ed your process," she said during a brief **meeting**. "The extra **careful**ness shows. Keep it up, but don't **let** it **slow** you **down** so **much** that you **miss** deadlines. Find the **balance**."

"I'm **work**ing on it."

"Good. And Alex? The error doesn't **define** you. How you **respond**ed to it—that's what matters in the **long** run."

A month after the error, Alex **cover**ed another community **event**—this one at a **small** **village**-style **neighbor**hood **gather**ing in the **bay**-area **section** of the city. The event featured children from a local **classroom** performing songs. He **interview**ed residents—including one who joked about needing a **loan** just to afford the rising rent—noted dates of the **neighbor**hood's founding, checked the spelling of every name against ID cards or business cards, and **verify**ed event details with multiple **organize**rs. He even confirmed the price of admission (**cash** only, five dollars) with the **organize**r twice.

When he **submit**ted the story, he **include**d a **supply** of **documentation**—photos of flyers with dates, screenshots of official neighborhood association records, even **reference** links to **historical** **document**s. Sarah didn't ask for all this **documentation**, but Alex wanted to demonstrate his changed **approach**.

The story **publish**ed without incident. No errors, no **correction**s, no angry emails. Just good, **solid**, **verify**able journalism.

Diana stopped by his desk. "Heard your neighborhood **gather**ing story was **clean**. Well done."

"Thanks. I'm still terrified of **make**ing another mistake."

"Good. A **slight** **health**y fear keeps you **sharp**. Just don't **let** it **paralyze** you. The goal isn't **perfect**ion—it's **consistent** **accuracy** and **quick** **correction** when errors **inevitably** happen."

"You think they're **inevitable**?"

"I think we're **human**. We're working fast, covering **complex** stories, **rely**ing on **source**s who sometimes give us **incorrect** information. The **challenge** is minimizing errors through good systems and **handle**ing them with integrity when they **occur**."

That evening, Alex wrote in his journal: "Today marks one month since my error. I've learned that mistakes don't **mean** you're not **good** enough—they **mean** you're **human** and have room to grow. The question isn't whether you'll **mess** up, but whether you'll **take** **responsibility** and **improve**. That's the only **unique** **response** that **matter**s. As my grandmother used to say, 'You catch more flies with **honey** than vinegar'—being gracious about your mistakes helps others forgive them."

He thought about **progress**, about how it wasn't linear or **neat**. You **advance**, you stumble, you **learn**, you **improve**. The error had been **painful**, but it had also been **necessary**—a **bone** that had to break to **heal** **strong**er.

His phone buzzed. A text from Marcus: "**Lunch** tomorrow? Want to **extend** an **invite** to the new **report**er starting Monday. Help them avoid some of our early mistakes."

Alex smiled and typed back: "Definitely. Happy to **share** what I've learned."

And that, he realized, was the full circle. You made mistakes, you learned, and then you helped others learn. Not from a place of **judge**ment but from shared **experience** in this difficult, essential work.

The **consequence**s of errors were **real** and **serious**. But so was the capacity to grow from them, to **establish** better systems, to earn back **trust** through better work.

As Alex turned off his computer for the night, he felt **something** shift. Not **relief** exactly, but **accept**ance. He'd made a mistake, **face**d the **consequence**s, and come out the other side **slightly** wiser and significantly more **careful**.

That was **progress**. **Slow**, **humble** **progress**, but **progress** nonetheless.

And in journalism, as in **life**, that was often the most **honest** **measurement** of success.
