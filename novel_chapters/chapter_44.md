# Chapter 44: Self-Doubt

Alex scrolled through social media late Monday **night**, comparing himself to former classmates who seemed to have it all figured out. Jessica Martinez had just been promoted to senior **tech** reporter at a major **publication**—her profile seemed to **display** a new **win** every **week**, this **round** showing a photo from some **industry** awards ceremony where she'd won a **championship** for investigative journalism. She'd made it look **easy** as a **pop** **star**, **double** the success in **half** the **time**. Derek Thompson was now working **for** a national newspaper, his byline appearing in the **print** edition weekly. Even his college roommate had somehow managed to **acquire** **wealth** working in **industrial** design, earning **enough** to buy a **new** house **without** breaking a **buck**.

Meanwhile, Alex sat in his **tiny** apartment, surrounded by **piles** of notes **for** a story about **poverty** and **welfare** programs that his editor had asked him to **revise** **for** the third time. The **range** of his self-**doubt** seemed **to** **stretch** from his professional abilities to his **life** choices.

His phone **buzzed**—a text from Marcus: "**Dude**, **stop** **comparing** yourself to people on social media. That's **how** you **tear** yourself apart. Everyone posts **only** their **wins**, **not** their losses."

**How** did Marcus **know** what he was doing? Alex **typed** back: "Am I **that** predictable?"

"You've been **quiet** **all** **week**. Plus, it's awards season. We **all** **do** this. **Watch** some TV and **go** to **sleep**."

But Alex couldn't **sleep**. He kept **thinking** about the story he'd just **filed**—a **piece** about **housing** **inequality** that felt **important** but also **somehow** incomplete. Had he **interviewed** enough sources? Had he **evaluated** the data **closely** enough? The **detective** **work** required **for** **good** journalism sometimes felt beyond his abilities. He'd covered a **shooting** involving an **Israeli** diplomat, interviewed a **prosecutor** about a **knife** attack, reported on **mass** evictions—each story seemed to **chip** **away** at his confidence rather than building it. The emotional **disorder** from having to **shift** between different traumatic topics was taking its **toll**.

He **opened** his **laptop** and **reread** the draft. Each **paragraph** seemed **weak**, each **argument** **vulnerable** to **criticism**. **Regardless** of **how** **hard** he **worked**, it **never** felt **good** enough. There were **numerous** better **journalists** out there—**people** with more **experience**, better **sources**, **sharper** **instincts**.

Jamie had told him this was normal, that **every** **creative** **person** experienced self-**doubt**. "It's **like** teaching," she'd said. "You **question** whether you're **reaching** the students, whether you're **making** a **difference**, whether you're **even** **qualified** to **be** in the **classroom**."

But **that** didn't make it **easier**.

Alex's phone rang—his father, calling at an **unusual** hour. "Dad? It's **late**. Is everything **okay**?"

"Can't a father **call** his son?" But there was **something** in his **voice**, a **tone** Alex recognized from **childhood**—the **one** his father used when **he** wanted to **say** **something** **difficult**.

"What's **wrong**?"

"I've been **thinking** about our **conversation** last **week**," his father said. "About your **career**, your choices. I want you to **know** I'm **proud** of you, son. **Really** **proud**. I don't **say** it enough. Your mother and I were at the **extreme** of worry, but I see now you're not some helpless **creature** out there. You have **command** over your **life**."

Alex felt **unexpected** **emotion** rise in his throat. "Thanks, Dad. That means a lot." He **paused**, then added, "I've been **doubting** myself a lot **lately**. Wondering if I made the **right** **choice**."

"That's **normal**," his father said in **reply**. "I felt the same **way** when I started my business. The **spiritual** **vice** of self-**doubt** **grips** every **person** trying to do something **meaningful**. You just have to **pack** it **away** when it gets too **heavy**."

"I **know** I **give** you a **hard** **time** about **stability** and **money**. But I've been **reading** your articles. You're **doing** **important** **work**. **Don't** let anyone—**including** yourself—tell you **otherwise**."

After they **hung** up, Alex sat in the **dark**, **processing** the **conversation**. His father, who'd always been his toughest **critic**, his biggest **supporter**, and somehow both at **once**.

He **closed** his **laptop** and **walked** to the **window**, looking out at the **city** **lights** that **stretched** into the **distance** like a **vast** **ocean**. **Somewhere** out there, **other** young **journalists** were probably **also** awake, **also** **doubting** themselves, **also** **wondering** if they were **good** enough.

The **mystery** of self-**worth** wasn't **something** you **solved** **once** and **for** **all**. It was an **ongoing** **battle**, a **constant** **evaluation**, a **never**-**ending** **process** of **weighing** your **achievements** against your **failures**.

But maybe **that** was **okay**. Maybe **doubt** was just **another** **layer** of the **work**, **another** **block** to **climb** over on the **highway** toward becoming **who** you wanted to **be**.

He thought about the **immigrant** families he'd **interviewed**, **people** who'd **risked** everything **for** a **chance** at a better **life**. He thought about the **homeless** **population** navigating the **harsh** **shelter** system. He thought about all the **people** whose stories **needed** **telling**, **regardless** of his **doubt**.

His **job** wasn't to **be** perfect. His **job** was to **show** up, **do** the **work**, and **tell** the **truth** as **best** he **could**. That would **have** to **be** enough.

The **next** **morning**, Alex **arrived** at the **newsroom** **early**. Sarah was already at her **desk**, **editing** something with the focused **intensity** that **made** her such a **good** editor.

"You're here **early**," she **observed**, glancing up.

"Couldn't **sleep**. **Decided** to **come** in and **revise** that **housing** **piece**."

Sarah **studied** him **for** a **moment**. "You're **too** **hard** on yourself, Alex. The **article** is **solid**. Is this about seeing Jessica's **award** on Twitter?"

He **laughed** despite himself. "Does everyone **monitor** my **emotional** **state**?"

"We're a **team**. We **pay** **attention**." She **gestured** to the **empty** **chair** **across** from her **desk**. "Sit. Let me tell you **something**."

Alex sat.

"**Every** **single** **journalist** I've **ever** **worked** with has **dealt** with self-**doubt**. The **bad** ones let it **paralyze** them. The **good** ones use it to **push** themselves to **be** better. You're in the **second** **category**, but you **need** to **learn** when **doubt** is **useful** and when it's just **destructive**."

"**How** **do** you **tell** the **difference**?"

"**Useful** **doubt** makes you **check** your sources **twice**, **verify** your **facts**, **consider** alternative **perspectives**. **Destructive** **doubt** makes you **compare** yourself to **people** with **completely** different **paths** and **resources**." She **paused**. "Jessica has a **rich** **family** backing her. Derek went to **Harvard**. You're from a **small** town in the **Midwest**, working at an **independent** **publication** that doesn't **pay** **well**. **Different** **contexts**, **different** **challenges**. Talk to your **fellow** **reporters** here—they'll tell you they all **struggle** with the same things. We're trying to **install** better mental health support **for** the team because of it."

"So I **should** just **accept** being **less** **successful**?"

"No, you **should** **define** success **for** yourself instead of **letting** social media **define** it **for** you. What **matters** to you? **Money**? **Fame**? **Impact**? **Truth**?"

Alex **thought** about it. "I want my **work** to **matter**. To make a **difference**. To **shine** a **light** on **problems** people **ignore**."

"Then **judge** yourself by **that** **standard**, not by whether you've **won** awards or **gotten** **promoted**. You're **twenty**-**six** **years** **old** and you're already writing **stories** that **change** **how** people **see** **important** **issues**. That's **remarkable**, even if Instagram doesn't **think** so."

Her **words** **helped**, but the **doubt** didn't **completely** **disappear**. It **lingered** like smoke, **shifting** and **changing** **shape** but **never** fully **gone**.

That **evening**, he met Jamie **for** dinner. She **took** **one** **look** at him and said, "**Rough** **week**?"

"I've been **questioning** everything. My abilities, my choices, whether I'm **actually** **any** **good** at this."

"Welcome to being human," Jamie said. "I **had** a **student** tell me **today** that I'm the **worst** teacher **he's** **ever** **had** because I **won't** **let** him **play** games on his phone **during** **class**. My **immediate** **thought** was: **maybe** he's **right**. **Maybe** I **am** terrible."

Alex **smiled**. "But you **know** you're not."

"**Intellectually**, yes. But **emotionally**? The **doubt** is **always** there. It's **part** of **caring** about **doing** **well**. If you didn't **doubt** yourself **at** **all**, you'd probably **be** **arrogant** and **terrible**. **Some** **doubt** means you're **paying** **attention**."

They **ordered** food—**bread** and **soup** **for** him, **pasta** **for** her—and **talked** about their **respective** crises of confidence. It **helped** to **know** he wasn't **alone**, that **everyone** **struggled** with **these** **feelings**.

"The **key**," Jamie said, **breaking** a **piece** of **bread**, "is not **letting** the **doubt** **control** you. Acknowledge it, **evaluate** whether it's pointing to a **real** **problem**, and then either **fix** the **problem** or **let** the **doubt** **go**."

"That sounds **easier** than it **is**."

"Most **important** **things** are."

Walking **home** that **night**, Alex felt slightly better. Not **pure** and confident, not **free** from **doubt**, but more **able** to **carry** it **without** **being** **crushed** by its **weight**.

He **thought** about the **dozen** **stories** he'd **reported** over the **past** **year**, the **people** he'd **met**, the **truths** he'd **helped** **uncover**. **Maybe** he wasn't the **best** **journalist** in the **city**, but he was **here**, doing the **work**, **trying** to make a **difference**.

And **maybe**, **for** **now**, **that** was enough. The **doubt** would **always** be there, a **constant** **companion** on this **journey**. But it didn't **have** to **be** the **commander** of his **ship**—just **another** **passenger** along **for** the ride.

He'd **keep** writing, **keep** **questioning**, **keep** **pushing** himself to **be** better. Not because he'd **conquered** **doubt**, but because he'd **learned** to **work** **alongside** it.

That, he **decided**, was its **own** kind of **victory**. An **exception** to the **rule** that **doubt** was **always** destructive. A **way** to **tie** his **insecurities** to his **passion** **for** the **work** itself.

The **shooting** **star** he'd **wished** on as a **kid**, the **dream** of becoming a **journalist**—it hadn't **turned** out **exactly** as he'd **imagined**. The **reality** was **harder**, more **complicated**, more **full** of **doubt** and **struggle**.

But it was **also** **more** **real**, more **meaningful**, more his.

And **that**, **despite** everything, felt **like** winning.
