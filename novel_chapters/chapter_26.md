# Chapter 26: Interview Skills

**Tuesday** morning arrived with crisp **winter** **light** streaming through the newsroom windows. Alex had barely settled at his desk when Diana Rodriguez appeared, **shop**ping bag in one hand, notebook in the other.

"You're coming with me today," she announced. "Sarah approved it. Consider this your **daily** apprenticeship in **how** not to **fuck** up an interview."

Alex grabbed his coat and notebook, hurrying to keep up as Diana moved at remarkable **speed** toward the elevator. "Where are we going?"

"City Hall. The mayor's holding a press conference about the new housing development proposal. But that's just the **front**—the **real** story is what he's not saying. I'll **demonstrate** how to dig beneath official statements."

They descended to street level and caught a taxi. Diana gave the address, then turned to Alex. "First lesson: always arrive early. Gives you time to **observe** the setting, chat with people **below** the official level—assistants, **facility** staff, security **guard**s. They often know more than they're supposed to."

"Do they actually **talk** to reporters?"

"Depends on your approach. You can't **charge** in **demand**ing information. You **settle** into conversations naturally. Be genuinely curious about their **daily** lives. That's how trust builds."

The taxi dropped them **in** **front** of City Hall, a grand **building** with white columns that reminded Alex of **European** architecture he'd seen **in** textbooks. They were twenty minutes early for the eleven o'clock press conference.

Diana led him through the **building**, greeting people by name. "Morning, **Carlos**. How's your daughter's graduation planning going?" To another: "**Sandra**, your new **shoe**s look great. **Where** did you **shop**?"

Alex watched, fascinated, as Diana remembered details about people's lives. This wasn't manipulation—it was genuine human connection. She actually cared, and people responded.

"Diana Rodriguez," an older security **guard** greeted her warmly. "Haven't seen you **in** a while. We **miss** you around here."

"Been busy, **Tom**. You know how it is. This is Alex, our new reporter. I'm showing him the ropes."

The **guard** shook Alex's hand. "Good luck. Learn from the best. Diana here, she's got more **intelligence** than all the politicians combined."

After they moved on, Alex asked: "How do you remember so **much** about so **many** people?"

"I take notes after every interaction, create mental **link**s. **Carlos**'s daughter is graduating **college**—he mentioned it three months ago. **Sandra** always compliments **shoe**s, so I **focus** on noticing them. It's not magic, just attention and practice."

The press conference room filled **slow**ly. Alex recognized several reporters from other outlets. Diana positioned them at the side, not **in** **front** where the cameras were. "Better **view** of facial expressions from this angle," she explained. "And we can see who the mayor's staff is watching."

At eleven, Mayor **Johnson** appeared, flanked by his **chief** of staff and the director of the Housing **Division**. The formal statement was polished, rehearsed—**lots** of optimistic language about "**affordable** housing," "community **development**," and "**measured** **growth**."

Diana typed notes on her laptop but also watched the **background**—the staff members' reactions, their whispered consultations. Alex tried to do the same, **aware** that he was **learn**ing a different kind of **reading** than he'd practiced before.

During the question period, a reporter from Channel 7 asked about projected costs. The mayor deflected smoothly. Another asked about the **facility**'s **location**. Again, vague reassurance.

Then Diana raised her hand. "Diana Rodriguez, The Metropolitan Voice. Mr. Mayor, a **recent** **poll** conducted by the **Housing** Rights **Institute** shows sixty-three percent of **resident**s in the proposed development area oppose this **plan**. They're concerned about displacement. Why should they trust this project won't **operate** **like** previous initiatives that **essentially** forced **long**-term **resident**s out?"

The room quieted. This wasn't a softball question. The mayor's **expression** shifted **slightly**—still controlled, but Diana had clearly touched a nerve.

"We've held **multiple** community **meeting**s," the mayor said carefully. "The **plan** includes **protection**s for current **resident**s."

"What specific **protection**s?" Diana pressed. "The **document**s released **online** don't include binding guarantees. Can you **commit** today to legally enforceable rent controls during and after development?"

"We're still finalizing those **detail**s—"

"So, no binding guarantees currently exist?"

The mayor's **chief** of staff leaned **in** to whisper something. The mayor nodded. "We're **committed** to **work**ing **within** existing **framework**s. Next question?"

As they left the press conference, Alex was buzzing with questions. "That was incredible. He was totally **unprepared** for you."

"Not **unprepared**," Diana corrected. "He knew I'd ask **tough** questions. But I **frame**d it **in** **term**s he couldn't easily dismiss—citing the **Institute**'s **poll**, referencing the **online** **document**s. Always ground **your** questions **in** verifiable facts. Makes it harder to **bullshit**. Last **presidential** election cycle, I used this technique **twice** to pin down candidates on policy specifics."

They walked to a **coffee** **shop** a **block** away. Diana ordered herbal **tea**; Alex got **coffee**. They settled into a corner **table** where they could **talk** without being overheard.

"Now comes the **real** **work**," Diana said, opening her notebook. "The press conference was **theater**—everyone performing their roles. We need the **actual** story. I'm meeting with a **source** at two o'clock, someone **in** the **Housing** **Division** who's willing to **talk** **background**. Want to **observe**?"

"**Definitely**," Alex said.

"Good. But you need to understand the **basic** rules. This **source** is taking a risk. They're not **speak**ing on the **record**. We're there to **listen** and **learn**, **gain** **understanding** that will help us find the **real** story. We don't **push** too **hard**, and we **absolutely** protect their **identity**."

Diana spent the next hour explaining **source** **relationship**s—how to **build** trust, when to **push** and when to wait, the **ethic**s of protecting identities while still **tell**ing **truth**. "**Basically**, it comes down to respect and patience," she said. "That's the formula." Alex took **lot**s of notes, aware he was receiving a **master** **class** in journalism that **most** **school**s couldn't **teach**.

At quarter to two, they walked three **block**s to a small **park** near the waterfront. Trees lined the pathways, reminding Alex of a miniature **forest**. A woman **in** her forties sat on a **bench**, appearing to read a book. Diana approached casually, and Alex **follow**ed.

"**Mind** if we sit?" Diana asked. "Beautiful spot here—**wild** flowers in summer, though it's pretty stark now."

"It's a **free** **country**," the woman replied—apparently their **code** to confirm identity.

Diana made quick introductions, using only first names. "This is **Jennifer**. She **work**s **in** **Housing** **Division** **planning**. Jennifer, this is Alex. He's **learn**ing the craft."

Jennifer looked Alex up and down. "Can I trust him?"

"**Fully**," Diana said without hesitation.

They sat, maintaining the appearance of three people casually **talk**ing **in** a **park**. Jennifer began speaking **slow**ly, carefully choosing her words.

"What the mayor didn't **say** today is that the development **plan** already has **buyer**s—**European** investment **firm**s **look**ing to **purchase** **building**s once construction **complete**s. The **rent** controls he vaguely mentioned? They're **measure**d to **operate** for only three years. After that, it's **market** **rate**, which means **thousand**s per month that current **resident**s can't **afford**."

"Do you have **document**ation?" Diana asked.

"Not that I can **share** without **los**ing my **job**. But **check** the **investor** **meeting** minutes from **August**. They're public **record**, filed with the **State** Securities **Division**. You'll need to **cross**-reference **multiple** **file**s, but the **link**s are there."

Diana was typing notes on her phone, **discreet**ly. "What's the timeline?"

"They want to break **ground** **below** the **winter** frost line, so construction must **start** by early **spring**. The mayor will **push** for **approval** within the next **quarter**—by **December** or **January** at the latest."

"Why are you **tell**ing us this?" Alex asked, then immediately worried he'd overstepped.

But Jennifer looked at him directly. "Because I grew up **in** that **neighborhood**. My **parent**s **still** **live** there—they **hire**d me to help run their small **farm** stand at the market. This **isn't** about **development**—it's about **displacement** **dress**ed up **in** nice language. Someone needs to **tell** the **truth**."

After Jennifer left, Diana and Alex sat **in** silence for a moment. The **winter** sun was bright but provided little warmth. Alex was processing what he'd just witnessed—a government employee risking her career to expose what she believed was wrong.

"What happens now?" Alex asked.

"Now we **do** the **work**," Diana said. "We **spend** the next **week** or two digging through **document**s, making calls, finding additional **source**s who can **confirm** Jennifer's information. We **operate** carefully, **slow**ly, **methodically**. One **source** **isn't** enough, especially an anonymous one."

"But what if the **approval** happens before we can publish?"

"Then we **work** faster. But we never sacrifice **accuracy** for **speed**. The moment we publish something we can't **defend**, we lose **credibility** and endanger our **source**s."

They walked back toward the **subway**, passing **shop**s and **building**s **fill**ed with people **living** their **daily** lives, **unaware** of the political **machine**s **work**ing **above** and around them. A produce vendor was packing up, reminding Alex of the **farm**ers markets back home. This was what journalism meant—**cross**ing the **divide** between public statements and hidden **truth**s, between official positions and **actual** impact on real people.

"How do you **handle** the pressure?" Alex asked. "Knowing you're holding information that matters, but you can't publish yet?"

"It's **difficult**," Diana admitted. "You learn to **separate** what you **feel** from what you can prove. Journalism **isn't** about being **right**—it's about being **accurate**. Sometimes that **mean**s sitting on a story you **believe** **in** your **soul** is **true** until you can **demonstrate** it **beyond** doubt."

Back at the newsroom, Diana disappeared into the archives, already hunting for the investment **meeting** minutes Jennifer mentioned. Alex sat at his desk, **review**ing his notes, aware that he'd received far more than interview **technique**s today.

He'd witnessed the **relationship** between journalists and **source**s who risk themselves to expose **truth**s. He'd seen how Diana balanced aggression and restraint, how she asked questions that **demand**ed **answer**s while maintaining **respect**. He'd learned that **real** journalism often happened **below** the surface of public events, **in** **private** conversations where trust was the **currency** and truth was the **goal**.

Sarah appeared at his desk. "Diana told me you did well today. Good **listening**, didn't **push** where you shouldn't. That's important."

"Thank you. It was **amazing** to **watch** her **work**."

"Diana's been doing this since before you were born. She knows how to **read** people, when to **press** and when to **wait**. Those **skill**s take years to **develop**. But you can **learn** them if you **pay** attention and **practice**."

That evening, Alex stayed late, helping Diana comb through **online** public **record**s. They found the August **meeting** minutes Jennifer mentioned—buried three layers deep **in** the State Securities **Division** website, cross-referenced with **European** investment **firm** **filing**s. It took hours of **slow**, **methodical** **search**ing, but Diana **knew** what patterns to **look** for. "This isn't **fun**, but it's necessary," she said as they **slowly** scrolled through page after page.

"There," Diana said, pointing at her screen. "**Castle** **Gate** Investments, registered **in** **Luxembourg**. They filed a **letter** of **intent** to **purchase** four **building**s **in** the proposed development **zone**. Filed **August** fifteenth, two weeks before the mayor announced the project."

"So they knew before the public announcement?"

"Looks that way. Which **raise**s questions about who's **really** **driving** this project and why."

They worked **until** nine o'clock, **build**ing a **file** of **evidence** that would eventually support their story. Alex marveled at Diana's patience—she never rushed, never jumped to conclusions, always asked "what else could this **mean**?" before accepting any interpretation.

Walking to the **subway** together, Diana said: "Today you learned an important **lesson** about journalism. It's not glamorous. **Lot**s of **time** spent **search**ing through boring **document**s, waiting for **source**s, **double**-checking facts. The exciting moments—the press conferences, the revelations—those are **few** and **far** between. **Most** of this **work** is **slow** and **methodical**. My **father** worked a **farm** upstate—planting, watering, waiting for harvest. Journalism is similar—**slow** cultivation until the truth is ready."

"I understand," Alex said. "But it **matter**s. What we're doing will help people understand what's **really** happening."

"**Exactly**," Diana said. "And that's why we do it right, even when it takes **extra** time. Our **responsibility** **isn't** to be **fast**—it's to be **accurate**."

On the **subway** home, Alex reflected on the day. He'd **watch**ed a **master** journalist **operate**, seen the **difference** between asking questions and asking **smart** questions, between wanting **answer**s and being willing to **work** for them.

He thought about Jennifer, the **Housing** **Division** employee who risked her career to expose what she **believe**d was wrong. He thought about Diana's careful, **methodical** approach to protecting that **source** while pursuing the **truth**. He thought about the **family**s who would be affected by this development, **liv**ing their **daily** lives **unaware** that decisions were being made that would **shape** their **future**s.

This was journalism—not the romanticized version from **movie**s, but the **actual**, **difficult**, essential **work** of holding power accountable and **tell**ing **truth**s that mattered.

Back **in** his **apartment**, Alex opened his notebook and wrote: "**Lesson**s from Diana: 1) Build **real** **relationship**s, not just **source** contacts. 2) Ground questions **in** verifiable facts. 3) Patience is a **skill**, not a weakness. 4) Protect **source**s **absolute**ly. 5) **Accuracy** **above** **speed**, always."

Tomorrow he'd **return** to the newsroom and continue the **slow**, **methodical** **work** of building this story. But tonight, he felt he'd crossed another threshold **in** his **development** as a journalist.

The **skill**s Diana **demonstrate**d couldn't be learned **quick**ly or **easy**. They required practice, patience, and a **commitment** to doing the **work** right even when it was **difficult**.

Alex was ready for that challenge. He was learning from the best, and he was determined not to waste this opportunity.

**Sleep** came easier now, the **anxiety** of being new replaced by the **satisfaction** of **learn**ing from a **master**. Tomorrow would **bring** new challenges, but he was **build**ing the **foundation** he needed to face them.

And that made all the **difference**.
