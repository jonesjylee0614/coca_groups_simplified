# Chapter 19: Homesick Moments

The rain started on **Saturday** morning in early **October** and hadn't stopped **by** evening. Alex sat in his tiny apartment, watching water **run** **down** the single window that faced the air shaft. The sound of rain was different here than in Riverside—not the **fresh** drumming on leaves and grass, but a **heavy** percussion against concrete and metal, **filtered** through the **environmental** noise of the city.

His laptop sat open on the small table that served as both desk and dining surface, a half-written article on the screen. Kevin's manager at the startup had assigned him a piece about **consumer** trends in sustainable products—not exactly the investigative journalism he'd dreamed of, but it was paid work. The article covered everything from **environmental**ly-friendly packaging to sustainably-sourced **fish** products. The **previous** week, he'd **deliver**ed his first article, and they'd been **content** with his work. "**Effective** writing," the **editor** had said in her email. "We'll have more assignments for you."

He should have felt **successful**. After weeks of **track**ing down leads and facing rejection, he finally had a **firm** connection to steady freelance income. The **investment** of time and energy in networking was paying off. He could **define** himself as a working writer now, even if the work wasn't what he'd imagined.

But tonight, alone in his apartment with rain falling and darkness settling in, success felt **hollow**.

His phone sat on the **chair** beside him, and he found himself staring at it, **afraid** to make the call he knew he needed to make. Every **Saturday** evening, he was supposed to call home. It was part of the **responsibility** he'd accepted when his parents had supported his move—staying connected, letting them know he was okay, maintaining the **relationship** that **define**d so much of who he was.

But tonight, he didn't feel okay. And he wasn't sure he could **handle** **fake** cheerfulness, couldn't **trust** himself to hide the loneliness that had been building for days.

The freelance work kept him busy but isolated. He worked alone in his apartment, staring at screens, researching **internet** trends and **consumer** behavior. His coffee shop group met on Sundays, which gave him something to look **forward** to, but the rest of the week felt empty. The city that had seemed so full of possibility now felt indifferent to his existence. Millions of people surrounded him, yet he'd never felt more **alone**.

His **device** buzzed with a notification—an email from Priya about tomorrow's coffee shop meeting. "Tom has **fresh** data for the housing article. Also, Jasmine is bringing homemade cookies. Don't miss it!"

The message should have lifted his **spirit**s. These were good people, genuine friendships forming. But instead, it reminded him how much effort it took to maintain connection here, how nothing felt **natural** or **easy** the way it had back home.

**Suddenly**, his phone rang. His mother's name appeared on the screen.

He answered **immediately**. "Hi, Mom."

"Alex! I was **just** thinking about you and thought I'd call instead of waiting for you to call us. How are you, sweetheart? It's **Saturday** evening—are you doing something fun?"

Her voice, warm and familiar, **broke** something open **inside** him. "I'm good," he said, the automatic response. "Just working on an article."

"On a **Saturday** night?" His mother's concern was immediate. "Alex, you need to have some **balance** in your life. You can't **just** work all the time. Are you eating properly? Getting **fresh** air? Making friends?"

"I have friends," Alex said. "I told you about the coffee shop group. We meet tomorrow."

"That's wonderful," she said. "And how's the journalism going? Have you heard back from any of those newspapers you applied to?"

This was the question he'd been **afraid** of. "Not yet," he said. "But I'm doing freelance work for a startup. Content writing, some research pieces. It's good experience."

There was a pause. His mother knew him too well. "But it's not what you wanted," she said gently.

"It's fine," Alex said, trying to keep his voice steady. "It pays. I'm **deliver**ing good work. The **editor** seems happy with what I'm producing."

"Alex." His mother's voice shifted to that particular tone that meant she saw through his pretense. "What's wrong? And don't say 'nothing.' I can hear it in your voice."

The dam broke. "I don't know, Mom. I thought... I thought if I just worked hard **enough**, if I networked and built connections and proved myself, things would click into place. But it's been months, and I'm still writing about **consumer** products and market trends instead of stories that **matter**. I'm living in a city where I don't really know anyone, in an apartment so small I can touch opposite walls with my arms spread. And tonight, listening to the rain, I **just**... I miss home. I miss you and Dad. I miss knowing where I **belong**."

He heard his mother's breath catch. "Oh, honey. I wish I could hug you right now."

"I'm okay," Alex said quickly, **immediately** regretting his honesty. "I'm **just** having a **bad** evening. The rain makes everything feel worse."

"It's not **funny** how weather can **affect** our mood," his mother agreed. "Your father always gets melancholy when it rains in **November**. Reminds him of his father, who passed in a rainstorm." She paused. "But Alex, what you're feeling—that's **normal**. It's **okay** to struggle. Moving to a new place, starting a new life—that's one of the hardest things a person can do. It doesn't mean you made the wrong choice."

"Doesn't it?" Alex asked. "Maybe I was naive to think I could make it here. Maybe small-town kids **lack** whatever **element** it takes to succeed in places like this."

"That's not true," his mother said **firm**ly. "You're not **lack**ing anything. You're **adapt**ing to an entirely new **cultural** **environment**, building a career in one of the most competitive cities in the world, all while maintaining your values and **integrity**. That takes incredible **strength**. Don't **judge** yourself so harshly **just** because it's **tough**."

From somewhere in the apartment, Alex could hear his neighbors through the thin walls—music playing, laughter, the sounds of lives being lived. **Directly** above him, someone was walking around, their footsteps a **heavy** rhythm against his ceiling. The sound of **ice** clinking in a glass came from the apartment next door.

"Tell me what you miss most," his mother said. "Sometimes naming it helps."

Alex thought about it. "I miss the quiet," he said. "Here, there's constant noise—sirens, construction, people, the subway rumbling underneath. Even the **wind** sounds different, channeled through buildings instead of across fields. I miss seeing stars at night. I miss knowing people's names when I walk down the street. I miss **Saturday** mornings at the diner with you and Dad, the same waitress who's been there since I was a kid. I miss the Memorial Day parade where Mr. Thompson always dressed up as a Revolutionary War **soldier**. I miss... I miss feeling confident about who I am and where I'm going."

"That's a lot to miss," his mother said softly. "And it's all **valid**. But let me ask you something—if you came home right now, would that solve it? Or would you feel like you gave up on something important?"

"I'd feel like I failed," Alex admitted. "Like I proved all the skeptics right, the ones who thought I was **crazy** to leave."

"So you're caught between two **difficult** feelings," his mother said. "Missing home and **fear**ing failure. That's a **hard** place to be, sweetheart."

Alex stood up and walked to the window, phone pressed to his ear. Through the rain, he could see lights in other buildings, other windows where other people were living their lives. Each one a story, a struggle, a collection of hopes and **fear**s. "How did you and Dad **decide** whether to stay in Riverside?" he asked. "Didn't you ever want to leave, try something different?"

His mother laughed quietly. "Oh, we talked about it. When we were first married, your father wanted to move to Chicago. He'd gotten a **job** offer from a **firm** there, good money, more opportunities. We even visited, looked at apartments. But in the end, we **decide**d the **cost** wasn't **worth** it—not **financial** **cost**, but the **cost** to our **spirit**s. We **define**d success differently than most people. We wanted **community**, **stability**, **family** nearby. So we stayed."

"Do you regret it?" Alex asked.

"Sometimes," she said honestly. "When I see friends who moved away and built these **interesting** lives in big cities, sometimes I wonder what we missed. But then I think about what we gained—watching you grow up with your grandparents nearby, knowing our neighbors for decades, being part of something stable and **enduring**. It's a trade-off. Every choice is."

"But how do you know if you're making the right trade?" Alex asked. "How do you know if what you're giving up is **worth** what you're getting?"

"You don't," his mother said. "Not **immediately**, anyway. Sometimes you have to **trust** the process, give it time to develop. You've only been there a few months, Alex. You're still in the hard early phase where everything feels difficult and nothing feels natural yet. It's not like understanding **nuclear** physics—there's no clear formula. But that doesn't mean it won't get better."

Alex watched the rain, thinking about **trust** and **time** and the **future** he was trying to build. "What if I'm not strong **enough**?" he asked quietly. The weight of the question sat on his **shoulder**s like something physical.

"You are," his father's voice said. He must have picked up the other phone. "Sorry to eavesdrop, but I heard your mother's side of the conversation and wanted to add something. Alex, do you remember when you were twelve and wanted to build that boat?"

Despite his mood, Alex smiled. "The one that sank **immediately** in the river?"

"That's the one," his father said. "You spent three months working on it. Read books, watched videos on the **internet**, bought materials with your **own** money. Calculated weight distribution like you were designing a **ship**. And when it sank on its first voyage, you were **devastate**d. You said you'd never try again, that you weren't cut out for building things."

"I remember," Alex said.

"But then what did you do?" his father asked.

"I... I built another one. A better one."

"Exactly," his father said. "You learned from the failure. You **adjust**ed your **approach**. And the second boat worked. Not perfectly—it still had problems—but it floated. It got you across the river. You didn't **lack** the ability; you **just** needed more **experience**."

"So you're saying my life is a sinking boat?" Alex asked, a hint of humor breaking through.

His father laughed. "I'm saying that feeling like you're sinking doesn't mean you actually are. You're in new waters, learning new skills, **adapt**ing to a new **environment**. Of course it feels **overwhelming**. But you're not drowning, son. You're swimming. Maybe not gracefully yet, but you're moving **forward**."

"Your father's right," his mother added. "And **besides**, you're not **alone** in this. You have us, even from a distance. You have your new friends. And you have yourself—your **talent**, your **determination**, your **spirit**. **Trust** those things."

They talked for another thirty minutes, the conversation drifting to lighter topics. His mother told him about the **governor**'s visit to Riverside, how the whole town had prepared for weeks and then he'd only stayed for forty-five minutes. She also mentioned that the **editor** of the local paper had **announce**d his retirement after forty years. His father shared **funny** stories from his work, a **client** who kept changing his mind about design specifications. He also mentioned running into Alex's old high school history teacher, Mr. Peterson, who'd **interested**ly asked about Alex's journalism career. They asked about his article, about the coffee shop group, about whether he was eating vegetables and getting enough sleep.

The **normal** rhythms of family conversation, the **familiar** patterns of care and concern, **slowly** **restore**d something in Alex. **By** the time they said goodbye, he felt less **alone**, more **anchor**ed.

After hanging up, Alex opened his **journal**—a physical notebook, not a digital **device**. He needed something **tangible** tonight, something that didn't require a screen. He wrote:

"**Saturday**, **October** 15th. Rainy evening. Called home feeling lost and came away feeling slightly less so. Mom said something important—that every choice is a trade-off, that I won't know if I made the right decision **immediately**. I need to give this more **time**, need to **trust** the process **even** when it feels **hard**.

"The **lack** I feel tonight—of **community**, of **belonging**, of **confidence**—maybe that's not permanent. Maybe it's **just** the **natural** **element** of **transition**. Like Dad said, I'm learning to swim in new waters. The fact that it's **difficult** doesn't mean I'm **fail**ing.

"I **define** success as writing stories that **matter**, that serve **communities**, that hold power **accountable**. I'm not doing that yet. But I'm building **toward** it. The freelance work, the networking, the article with Priya and Tom—these are **investment**s in my **future** self. Seeds being planted that will **eventually** grow into something more.

"The **responsibility** I have is not **just** to my dreams but to the process of achieving them. That means being patient with myself, **trust**ing that growth takes **time**, accepting that some **Saturday**s will be **hard** and lonely but that doesn't **define** the entire **experience**.

"I miss home. But I'm **also** building a new home here, slowly, one connection at a **time**. It's okay to hold both feelings—the missing and the building. They don't **cancel** each other out; they **coexist**, both **valid**, both part of this **journey**."

He set **down** the pen and looked around his small apartment. It wasn't much—the **furniture** was **minimal**, the walls bare except for one **photograph** of his family he'd **hang** above his desk. But it was his. His space in this vast city, his launching point into whatever came next.

The rain was **let**ting up, the **heavy** **pour** **soften**ing to a **gentle** patter. Through his window, he could see the lights of the city **extend**ing in all **direction**s, millions of people living out their own **struggle**s and **triumph**s.

His phone buzzed again. A **text** from Kevin: "Hope you're doing okay tonight. Weather like this always makes me homesick too. Remember—we're all figuring this out together. See you tomorrow at coffee shop? We can **feed** our souls with Jasmine's cookies and good conversation."

Then Priya: "In case you need to hear it: you belong here. Your voice **matter**s. Keep going."

And Tom: "**Just** read your **draft** for our article. Your writing **capture**s exactly what I was trying to **express** in my research. Excited to see where this goes."

Three messages, three people who barely knew him three months ago, now checking in, offering support, building the **foundation** of **community** he'd been missing.

Maybe this was how it worked, Alex thought. Maybe home wasn't **just** a place you came from but also something you built, piece **by** piece, connection **by** connection. The **collection** of people who knew you, who cared about your **well-being**, who **invest**ed in your success—that could be home too, **even** if it looked different than what you'd known before.

He opened his laptop and returned to the article about **consumer** sustainability. It wasn't the story he dreamed of writing, but it was the story he was **trust**ed to write **now**. And maybe doing it well, **deliver**ing quality work **even** when it wasn't his passion, was its **own** form of **responsibility**—to his **editor**, to himself, to the **future** where bigger opportunities might come **because** he'd proven himself reliable.

The **wind** picked up outside, **carry**ing the last of the rain clouds away. **By** morning, the sky might be clear. **Sunday** would bring the coffee shop meeting, Jasmine's cookies, conversation with people who understood the **struggle** of building lives in this **tough** city. And then **Monday** would bring new work, new challenges, new chances to prove himself.

It wasn't the **future** he'd imagined **exactly**. But it was a **future** nonetheless, one he was **active**ly creating **rather** than **passive**ly receiving. And on nights like this, when loneliness felt **heavy** and **overwhelming**, maybe that was **enough**—to know that tomorrow existed, that he had people to see and work to do, that he was building something **even** if he couldn't see the **complete** **structure** yet.

Alex worked on his article until midnight, the words coming more **easy** now that he'd **release**d some of the **emotion**al weight. When he finally closed his laptop and **prepare**d for bed, he felt **different** than he had hours earlier. Still missing home, still uncertain about the **future**, but less **afraid**. More **trust**ing that he could **handle** whatever came next.

**By** the time his head hit the pillow, he'd made a decision. Next **Saturday**, when he called home, he'd be **honest** about the **struggle**s but **also** about the **progress**. He'd tell them about the article with Priya and Tom, about the friendships forming, about learning that homesickness was **normal** and didn't mean he'd made the wrong choice.

His parents had **trust**ed him to figure this out. Now he needed to **trust** himself.

Outside, the city hummed with its **endless** energy, **indifferent** to his **individual** **struggle** but **somehow** **also** holding space for it. Millions of stories, millions of **journey**s, millions of people learning to swim in waters that felt **too** deep, **too** **cold**, **too** vast.

But learning nonetheless.

Swimming nonetheless.

Building home nonetheless.

And that was **fair** **enough** for tonight.
