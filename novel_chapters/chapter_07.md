# Chapter 7: Small Town Scenery

Alex woke **before** dawn on his last full day in Riverside. Sleep had been elusive, his mind too full of thoughts about tomorrow's departure. Rather than lying in bed dwelling on the **future**, he decided to take one final bike ride through the places that had shaped his youth.

His old bicycle still hung in the garage, dusty but functional. His **dad** had kept it maintained over the years, even though Alex hadn't ridden it in ages. The tires needed air, but otherwise it was in good **condition**. He pumped them up quietly, trying not to wake his parents, then wheeled the bike out into the pre-dawn darkness.

The air was cool and fresh, carrying the earthy scent of the nearby river. Alex pedaled slowly through the empty streets, his **attention** drawn to details he'd **nearly** stopped noticing over the years. Mrs. Henderson's garden, where **red** roses climbed a white trellis. The old fire station with its vintage truck parked outside, a relic from an earlier **period** in the town's history. The **bank** building on the corner, its brick **wall** bearing faded painted advertisements from decades past.

He headed east, toward the river that ran along the edge of town. This route was familiar territory—he'd biked it countless times as a teenager, often to escape to his favorite thinking spots. The **county** road that led out of town was **nearly** empty at this hour, just a single car passing him as he pedaled.

The sky was beginning to lighten, painting everything in shades of gray and purple. Alex had always loved this time of morning, the quiet **period** between night and day when the world seemed to hold its breath. It gave him space to think, to **focus** on what mattered.

His first destination was the old iron bridge that crossed Miller's Creek. It wasn't much—just a **short** span over a shallow waterway—but it held significance for him. This was where he'd come to read as a teenager, sitting on the **bank** with a book while the water made its gentle **sound** below. His **goal** had been to read one book per week that summer **before** senior year, and he'd achieved it, finishing all fifty-two titles on his **list**.

He leaned his bike against the bridge railing and walked to the center, looking down at the water below. The creek was lower than usual—the **general** **condition** of late summer, his **dad** would have said, when rain was **less** frequent. But it still flowed, still made that familiar murmuring **sound** that had been the soundtrack to so many hours of reading and thinking.

A **dog** barked in the distance, probably old Murphy from the Henderson farm. Some things, Alex thought, never changed. That same **dog** had been barking at shadows for as long as he could remember—or perhaps it was Murphy's **second** or **third** generation. Time had a way of blurring such details.

He mounted his bike again and continued along the creek path, a dirt trail that wound through a small wooded area. Sunlight was beginning to filter through the trees, creating patterns on the ground. This grove had been his hideaway as a child, a place where he and his friends had built forts from fallen branches and random **stuff** they'd collected, playing elaborate games and pretending to be explorers or soldiers or **author**s on great adventures.

At a **point** where the path widened, Alex stopped and looked around. Over there was the clearing where Sarah Chen's **daughter**—no, wait, Sarah didn't have children yet. He was thinking of Mrs. Chen, his science teacher, **whose** **daughter** had been in the class ahead of him. The **thought** made him smile. How easily memory could confuse timelines and relationships.

He continued riding, emerging from the woods onto farmland. The Carlson property stretched out to his right, acres of corn nearly ready for harvest. Mr. Carlson stood near his pickup truck, drinking coffee and surveying his fields. His gray **hair** was visible beneath his worn cap, a reminder that even he was aging. He raised a hand in greeting, and Alex waved back. No words were needed—this was countryside **behavior**, the simple acknowledgment between neighbors.

The local **economy** had always been tied to farming, though that was changing. Alex had written an article about it for his high school newspaper, interviewing farmers about the challenges they faced: corporate agriculture, changing weather patterns, the **industry**'s consolidation. Many family farms were struggling, their **land** worth more to developers than to the next generation of farmers.

His next stop was the old railway bridge—not used since the **industry** had shifted away from rail transport decades ago. The tracks were gone, pulled up and sold for scrap, but the stone supports remained. Local kids still called it "the bridge," as if there were only one in town, though there were several.

Alex climbed off his bike and walked carefully along the former rail bed, now overgrown with weeds and wildflowers. From this vantage **point**, he could see most of Riverside spread below: the church steeple, the school building, the water tower with "RIVERSIDE" painted on its side in fading letters. It looked smaller from up here, more fragile somehow, as if the whole town could be packed up and moved with **no** great **deal** of effort.

But he knew that wasn't the **truth**. Small towns like this had roots that went deep, connections between people and places that couldn't be easily severed. His departure wouldn't change that. Riverside would continue, adapting or struggling or simply persisting, regardless of whether he was here to witness it.

He pulled out his phone—he'd brought it specifically to take photos, wanting to capture these places **before** they became just memories. The camera wasn't as good as a real one would be, but his **dad** had shown him some basic photography tricks. "**Focus** on the composition," he'd said. "The story you're trying to tell."

Alex **certainly** tried to apply that advice now, framing shots of the town, the bridge, the farmland. Each photo would serve as a **note** to his **future** self, a reminder of where he came from. He made a mental **list** of all the places he wanted to photograph **before** leaving.

A **thought** struck him about the nature of photographs and memory. He'd read an essay once—he couldn't recall the **author**—about how photographs could both preserve and distort memory. We remember the photo rather than the actual moment, the essay argued, creating a **second**-hand version of our own experience. Looking **upon** the scene through his phone's screen **before** him, Alex wondered if that was true.

He decided it didn't matter. The **point** wasn't to perfectly preserve the past but to honor it, to acknowledge what these places meant to him. That was his **goal** this morning—not documentation but recognition.

Riding on, he passed the old drive-in theater, long since closed. The massive screen still stood, though the white paint had faded and peeled. This was where his parents had gone on their first date, his **dad** had told him, back when drive-ins were the height of romance and entertainment. Now it was just a **figure** from the past, a reminder of how quickly things could change.

The **general** pattern of the town's decline wasn't unique to Riverside. Small towns across the **county**, across the **country**, faced similar challenges. Young people left for opportunities elsewhere. Jobs disappeared as industries changed. The **economy** shifted in ways that favored cities over rural communities.

Yet people remained, choosing to make their lives here. The Hendersons farming their **land**. The **officer** at the police station—Alex could see the squad car parked outside the small brick building—maintaining **order** and safety. The **husband** and wife team running the hardware store on Main Street. They'd all made a **deal** with this place, an implicit agreement to stay and contribute despite the challenges.

Alex understood that **deal** now in a way he hadn't **before**. These people weren't stuck here—they'd chosen it, **likely** for reasons that had nothing to do with **economy** or **industry**. Family, **community**, belonging—those things mattered too, perhaps more than he'd appreciated when he was younger and desperate to leave.

He pedaled toward his final destination: the reservoir on the north side of town, where teenagers gathered in summer to swim and build **fire**s on the beach. It was technically illegal, but the local police **officer** generally looked the other way as long as no one caused trouble. That was small-town life—rules existed, but so did discretion and understanding.

The reservoir was quiet this morning, the water smooth as glass. Alex sat on the sandy **bank**, his bike **close** beside him, and watched the sun complete its rise over the horizon. The light transformed everything, turning the water golden, making the whole scene look like something from a painting.

This was where he'd come with his friends for bonfires and conversations that felt profound at the time. Where Sarah had **nearly** broken her **arm** attempting to **shoot** a basketball into a makeshift hoop they'd set up. Where they'd stayed up **nearly** all night once, talking about their plans and dreams, none of them certain what the **future** held but all of them eager to find out.

A **series** of memories washed over him: swimming races, **short** romances that felt epic at the time, conversations about everything and nothing. He could **nearly** hear their younger voices, could almost see them all gathered around a **fire**, the flames casting dancing shadows on their faces.

His phone buzzed—a text from his **dad**: "Don't **forget** breakfast before you leave. Mom's making pancakes." Alex smiled and typed back a quick response, noting the time. He'd been out for **nearly** two hours already. Where had the time gone?

As he prepared to head back, Alex took one last look around. These places—the bridge, the creek, the reservoir, the old rail bed—they'd been his classroom in ways that school never was. They'd taught him about solitude and friendship, about the patience required to sit still and observe, about the beauty that existed in ordinary places if you paid **attention**.

The **truth** was, he realized, that he didn't need to **forget** any of this to move forward. The false choice he'd been constructing in his mind—small town versus big city, past versus **future**—wasn't real. He could honor both, carry these places and experiences with him while building something new.

The ride back to town was faster, Alex's legs warmed up and his spirits lifted. He passed familiar landmarks: the elementary school where he'd learned to read, the park where summer concerts were held, the library **whose** collection had seemed infinite when he was young. Each place got a mental goodbye, a silent acknowledgment of its role in shaping him.

Near home, he encountered Mrs. Chen walking her **dog**. She waved and called out, "Big day tomorrow! We're all so proud of you!"

"Thank you!" Alex called back, meaning it sincerely.

Back in the garage, he carefully hung up the bicycle, taking a moment to appreciate its faithful service over the years. It had carried him through countless adventures, provided escape when he needed it, been a tool for exploration and discovery. Now it would wait here, ready for his visits home, a symbol of the person he'd been and the place that had shaped him.

Inside, the smell of pancakes greeted him, along with his parents' smiling **face**s. His **dad** was reading the newspaper—the actual physical paper, not a **computer** screen—while his **mom** flipped pancakes at the stove.

"There you are," she said. "We were beginning to **figure** you'd ridden all the way to the city already."

"Just making the rounds," Alex replied, washing his hands at the sink. "Saying goodbye to old haunts."

"Good," his **dad** said, looking up from the paper. "Those places are **certain** to be here when you visit, but it's right to mark the moment. To acknowledge transitions."

They sat down to breakfast together, and Alex told them about his morning ride, describing what he'd seen and felt. His parents listened with **close** **attention**, understanding that this ritual had been important, necessary even.

As they ate, Alex felt a sense of peace settling over him. The **risk** of leaving, the uncertainty of what lay ahead—it was still there, still real. But so was this foundation, this knowledge of where he came from and who had shaped him.

The small-town scenery would remain, continuing its quiet existence whether he was here to witness it or not. And somehow, that was comforting. Change was inevitable, necessary even. But some things endured, providing anchors in the storm of transformation.

And that, Alex thought as he finished his pancakes and prepared for his final day in Riverside, was **certainly** worth remembering.
