# Chapter 9: Dreams and Fears

The **summer** night air was **hot** and heavy as it drifted through Alex's open window, but he couldn't sleep. He lay in **bed**, staring at the ceiling of his childhood room, his mind racing with thoughts about tomorrow. The **entire** house was silent except for the occasional creak of old wood settling and the distant sound of **animal** calls from the woods beyond town.

This was his last night in Riverside. The **place** that had been home for his **entire** life would, by tomorrow afternoon, be fifty **mile** behind him. The thought filled him with equal parts excitement and dread.

Alex got up and paced the **floor**, his bare feet **silent** on the worn carpet. Through the window, he could see Main Street a few blocks **away**, its streetlights creating pools of yellow light in the darkness. Everything looked so peaceful, so **natural**. And he was choosing to leave it all behind.

"What am I doing?" he whispered to himself.

The question had been haunting him all week. He'd wanted this for so long—the chance to become a journalist, to write stories that **mattered**, to **seek** truth and **represent** voices that needed to be heard. But now that the moment had arrived, doubt crept in **like** fog off the river.

He thought about Mrs. Peterson, his English teacher, who'd first encouraged his writing. "You have the **ability** to observe and articulate what others miss," she'd told him. "That's a **significant** gift." But was that enough? The city was full of talented people, all competing for the same opportunities. What made him think he could succeed where others **failed**?

His phone buzzed on the nightstand—a text from Marcus: "You awake?"

Alex responded immediately: "Yeah. Can't sleep."

"Same. Want to talk?"

Within minutes, Marcus was at the front door. They sat on the porch steps, **like** they had countless times before, speaking in low voices so as not to wake Alex's parents.

"Second thoughts?" Marcus asked.

"More **like** hundredth thoughts," Alex admitted. "I keep doing this **analysis** in my head—weighing everything that could go wrong against everything that might go right."

"And what's the **amount** of things in each category?"

"Pretty equal," Alex said. "That's the problem. I could **fail** spectacularly. The city is expensive—I'll be spending every **dollar** just to survive. What if I can't find work? What if I'm not good enough?"

Marcus was quiet for a moment. "Remember when **Congress** **passed** that education **bill** last year? The one that cut funding for small-town schools?"

"Yeah," Alex said, confused by the subject change.

"Sarah was devastated. She thought it meant the end of her grant program. But instead of giving up, she **sought** alternative funding. She wrote to every **state** **agency**, local businesses, even **individual** **donors**. She **protected** her program by refusing to accept **failure**, and I'd say her situation was **similar** to what you're facing now—you have to **protect** what matters to you."

"What's your point?"

"My point is that you're more **like** Sarah than you think. When you believe in something, you find a way. You don't give up just because there's an **attack** on your plans or your confidence."

Alex smiled. "When did you become so wise?"

"I've always been wise, **sir**," Marcus said with mock formality. "You were just too busy planning your escape to notice."

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, watching the empty street. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barked. A car drove **past**, its headlights briefly illuminating the night before darkness returned.

"You know what scares me most?" Alex said finally. "Not the city itself, but what it **represents**. Going there means I'm committed to this **career** path. If I **fail**, I can't just say 'Oh well, it was worth a try.' It'll mean I **failed** at the thing I've wanted most."

"That's not how it works," Marcus countered. "You're not going to the city for one attempt. You're going for a journey. **Individuals** don't succeed or **fail** based on single moments—they grow through experience. Look at my dad's hardware **store**. He's **failed** at dozens of product lines over the years, but the **store** itself succeeds because he keeps adapting."

"I guess," Alex said, though he didn't sound convinced.

"Listen," Marcus said, turning to face him directly. "I'm going to make a **statement** here, and I want you to really hear it. You're one of the most determined people I know. When you were on the school **board** committee for the journalism **club**, you fought for funding when everyone said no. You wrote **articles** for the school paper that actually made people think. You **helped** me write my college application essay, and I got in because of that **help**. You have what it takes."

Alex felt emotion rising in his throat. "Thanks, man."

"Besides," Marcus added with a grin, "if you **fail**, you can always come back and work at the hardware **store** with me. I could use someone to **fill** the paint department. Though your **performance** would have to be pretty good—we have high standards."

Alex laughed despite himself. "I'll keep that as my backup plan."

They talked for another hour, discussing everything from politics to relationships. Marcus mentioned that he'd started dating Emily from the **hospital**—she worked in administration, processing **bills** and insurance claims. "It's **serious**," he said. "I think she might be the one."

"That's great," Alex said sincerely. "See? You're figuring out your life. Maybe I can too."

"Of course you can," Marcus assured him. "You're not lacking in **ability**. You're just scared, which is **natural**. Anyone would be."

Eventually, Marcus headed home, and Alex returned to his room. But sleep still wouldn't come. His mind kept spinning through scenarios, comparing his dreams to reality, analyzing every **factor** that might contribute to success or **failure**.

He thought about journalism itself—what it meant in the twenty-first **century**. The industry was changing rapidly. Traditional newspapers were struggling. People got their news from social media, often without caring whether it was accurate. What role could he play in that landscape?

But then he remembered why he'd chosen this path. Not for fame or money, though he'd need enough **dollars** to survive. Not even for the prestige, though recognition would be nice. He wanted to be a journalist because democracy depended on informed citizens. Because truth **mattered**. Because someone needed to **represent** the stories that would otherwise go untold.

Those thoughts **helped** a little. They reminded him of his purpose, his **defense** against doubt.

He picked up his phone and scrolled through his photos. There was the picture from tonight at the diner—his friends smiling, arms around each other. That image would go with him to the city, a reminder of where he came from and who believed in him.

His parents too. Tomorrow they'd drive him to the train station, and he knew his mother would cry. They'd sacrificed to **help** him get this far—encouraging his education, supporting his dreams even when they were scared for him. He couldn't let them down. More importantly, he couldn't let himself down.

Alex thought about the political landscape too. The country felt divided in ways he'd never seen before. **Democrat** and Republican voters seemed unable to have civil conversations. People **usually** **vote** along party lines without really considering the **issues**. Social media **attacks** replaced reasoned debate. **Sex**, race, religion—everything had become weaponized in the culture wars.

Maybe that's where he could make a difference. Maybe he could write stories that **helped** people understand each other, that bridged divides instead of widening them. It seemed impossibly idealistic, but wasn't that the point of dreams?

He glanced at his alarm clock. 3 AM. In a few hours, his parents would wake up. His mother would make his favorite breakfast—probably pancakes with the good syrup from the **store** in the next town over. Then they'd load his bags into the car, and the final chapter of his childhood would close.

The thought was both terrifying and exhilarating.

Alex got up again and went to his desk, where he'd left his laptop. He opened a blank document and started writing—not an **article**, not anything structured, just thoughts pouring out onto the screen.

"I'm scared," he typed. "Terrified, actually. But I'm also ready. I've been preparing for this my **entire** life without knowing it. Every book I've read, every conversation I've had, every **example** of good writing I've studied—it's all been leading here. Tomorrow I step into the unknown, and I have no idea if I'll succeed. But I know I have to try. Because the alternative—staying here, wondering 'what if' for the rest of my life—is worse than any **failure** I might face."

He wrote for another thirty minutes, filling pages with his fears and hopes, his analysis of himself and his dreams. This **material** would become part of his journal, a record of this pivotal moment. It felt **like** therapy, getting it all out of his head and onto the page. Every **cell** in his body felt charged with nervous energy, buzzing with anticipation.

**Recently**, Mrs. Peterson had told him that writers write because they have to—because the stories inside them demand to be told. "You'll know you're a real writer," she'd said, "when you **realize** you can't **not** write, even when it's hard."

Maybe that was his answer. Maybe he was meant for this **career** because he couldn't imagine any other. The thought was both comforting and challenging.

Finally, as the first hints of dawn colored the sky outside his window, Alex felt himself growing tired. He closed his laptop and returned to **bed**. Tomorrow—today, actually—he would board a train and begin a new life. He didn't know what awaited him in the city. He didn't know if his dreams would come true or if he'd have to **compare** his expectations to a harsher reality.

But he knew one thing for certain: he was going to try. He was going to give everything he had to this dream. And whatever happened, at least he'd know he'd been brave enough to **seek** what he wanted instead of letting fear keep him in **place**.

As sleep finally claimed him, Alex's last thought was of his father's words from dinner: "The only real **failure** is not trying."

Tomorrow, he would try. And that, for now, was enough.
