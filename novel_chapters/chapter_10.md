# Chapter 10: The Day of Departure

Morning light filtered through the curtains, **beautiful** despite the emotional weight of the day. Alex woke to the **sound** of his mother moving around in the kitchen below, preparing what would be their last breakfast together for a while. The **quality** of the morning felt different—charged with significance, every moment weighted with finality.

He dressed **quickly**, pulling on jeans and a comfortable shirt for the train ride. His bags sat by the door, packed and ready. Everything he was bringing to start his new life fit into two suitcases and a backpack. It didn't seem like **enough** to build a future on, but it would have to do.

Downstairs, the kitchen table was covered with food. His mother had prepared **enough** for a small army—pancakes, eggs, bacon, fresh fruit, toast. She was keeping herself busy, he **realized**, channeling her anxiety into action.

"Good morning," she said, her voice falsely bright. "I wasn't sure what you'd want, so I made everything."

"Thanks, Mom," Alex said, giving her a hug. She held on a **bit** longer than usual.

His father **enter**ed the kitchen, already dressed and holding the car keys. "Train leaves at 10:30," he said. "We should leave here by 9:45 to be safe. That gives us about an hour."

An hour. Sixty minutes before everything changed.

They ate mostly in silence, each lost in their own thoughts. Alex's mother kept **pressing** more food on him. "You need to eat well. Who knows when you'll have a proper meal in the city?"

"They have food there, Mom," Alex said gently.

"I know, I know," she said. "I just **worry**. It's what mothers do."

His father cleared his throat. "I put together some **financial** information for you." He slid a folder across the table. "Basic budget **template**, the bank account details we **set** up for emergencies, phone numbers for everything. I also **left** you a **note** about **resources** in the city—community centers, places to get help if you need it."

"Thanks, Dad," Alex said, touched by the thoroughness. His father had always been practical, showing love through preparation and planning.

"There's also some money in there," his father added. "Not a huge **amount**, but **enough** to cover a few months' rent if you run into trouble. We don't want you to **worry** about that."

"I can't **accept** that," Alex protested. "You've already done too much."

"You can and will," his mother said firmly. "Consider it an investment in your future. **Thus**, you won't have to stress about every **dollar**."

Alex felt tears **pressing** behind his eyes but fought them back. "I don't know how to thank you."

"Just succeed," his father said simply. "That's all the thanks we need. And call us. Regularly."

"Every week," his mother added. "And if you meet **somebody** **interesting**, we want to hear about them. Your **sister** managed to call every week from college, so you can too."

Alex smiled. "I don't have a **sister**, Mom."

"Well, if you did, she'd call," his mother said stubbornly, and they all laughed despite the tension. It was easier to joke **rather** than **act** on the sadness they all felt.

At 9:45 exactly, they loaded the car. Alex took one last look at the house—the **beautiful** old Victorian with its wraparound porch and slightly crooked shutters. The **plant** his mother had **nurtured** for years climbed up the trellis beside the door. The mailbox his father had repainted just last **summer** stood at attention by the curb.

The drive to the station took twenty minutes. They passed familiar landmarks—the high school, the library, the park where Alex had learned to ride a bike. Each **scene** felt precious now, something to memorize before it disappeared into memory.

"You'll come back for Thanksgiving, won't you?" his mother asked from the front seat.

"Of course," Alex assured her. "That's only a few months **away**."

"It seems like a long time," she said **quietly**.

The train station sat on the **south** edge of town, a small brick building that served both passenger and freight trains. A few other people waited on the platform—an elderly couple heading **west** to visit grandchildren, a businessman in a suit checking his phone, a young woman Alex didn't recognize. Over the past **decade**, this station had witnessed countless goodbyes like theirs.

They had fifteen minutes before boarding. Alex's father helped him carry his bags to the platform while his mother hovered nearby, her hands twisting the strap of her purse.

"Did you pack your good jacket?" she asked for the third time.

"Yes, Mom."

"And your medicine for allergies?"

"Don't need it, Mom. I'm fine."

"But what if the city air bothers you? The **treatment** for allergies is important—and what about finding a good doctor? You'll need to **identify** a clinic, get established as a patient—"

"Mom," Alex said gently, taking her hands. "I'm going to be okay. I promise. I can **answer** all these questions once I get settled."

She nodded, tears finally spilling over. "I know. I know you will be. You're smart and capable and ready for this. I just **wish** we could **reduce** the distance between us. I **wish** you didn't have to go so far."

"It's for the best," Alex said, though his own voice was shaky. "This is what I need to do."

His father put a hand on Alex's shoulder. "Your mother and I were talking last night. We wanted to **mention** something—we're proud of you. Not just for going to the city, but for having the courage to pursue what you want. That takes real strength. You're taking the right **approach** to your future."

"We don't **argue** about it," his mother added. "We both agree completely. You're doing the right thing, even though it's hard for us. This **sort** of **loss**—watching you leave—it's painful but necessary."

The train whistle **sounded** in the distance. Five minutes.

"I should tell you something," Alex said, the words rushing out. "I'm terrified. I keep thinking about all the ways this could go wrong. But I also **know** that I have to try. You taught me that—to move **forward**, to take risks, to believe in myself."

"We did teach you that," his father agreed. "And we taught you well. You have all the **knowledge** and tools you need. Now you just have to **prove** it to yourself. You'll find your way to succeed, whether through journalism or some other path. You might even become a **candidate** for major awards someday."

The train pulled into the station, its brakes squealing. The **movement** on the platform increased as people gathered their belongings.

"This is it," Alex said unnecessarily.

His mother pulled him into a fierce embrace. "Call when you arrive. And eat properly. And don't talk to strange people on the train—wait, do talk to people, make connections, but be safe about it—and when you have free time, don't just watch **TV** all day. Read books, explore the city, play a **sport** or join a gym—"

"Mom," Alex laughed through his tears.

She released him, and his father stepped **forward** for a handshake that turned into a hug. "Go show them what you can do," he said. "Make your mark. **Claim** your place in the world."

"I'll try," Alex promised.

"And remember," his father added, "there's no shame in coming home if you need to. This isn't an all-or-nothing proposition. We're here if you need us."

"But you won't," his mother said quickly. "Need to come home, I mean. You'll do wonderfully."

The conductor called for boarding. Alex grabbed his bags and turned toward the train, then turned back for one more look at his parents. They stood **together** on the platform, his mother leaning into his father's **side**, both of them trying to smile despite their tears.

"I love you both," Alex said.

"We love you too," they replied in unison.

Alex boarded the train, finding a window seat in the third car. He stowed his larger bags overhead and kept his backpack with him, along with the folder his father had prepared. Through the window, he could still see his parents on the platform. Above his seat, a small hook allowed passengers to **hang** their coats.

The train began to move, **slowly** at first, then picking up speed. Alex watched as his parents waved, his mother's hand raised high, his father's arm around her shoulders. They grew smaller and smaller until the train rounded a curve and they disappeared from view.

He was alone now. Actually alone, heading into a new life.

The countryside rolled past his window—familiar fields and forests, the river that ran alongside the tracks for several **miles**. This **section** of the journey felt **safe**, known territory. But eventually the landscape would change, becoming unfamiliar, leading him to a destination he'd only imagined.

Alex opened his father's folder. Inside, neatly organized in **sections**, were documents covering every practical **subject** imaginable. Budget worksheets showed how to **determine** necessary expenses. A list of **resource**s included job search websites, community organizations, affordable grocery stores. His father had even **noted** the locations of libraries and parks, places where Alex could go without spending money.

Tucked in the back was a handwritten **note**: "Alex—Your mother and I believe in you completely. These past two decades watching you grow have been the greatest **benefit** of our lives. Now it's your turn to build something of your own. Be brave, be smart, be yourself. We're always here if you need us. Love, Dad."

Alex folded the **note** carefully and put it in his wallet, something to carry with him always.

The train picked up speed, the rhythmic **sound** of wheels on tracks creating a steady heartbeat. Other passengers settled in for the journey—reading, working on laptops, staring out windows at the passing landscape.

Alex thought about what lay ahead. He'd need to find an apartment **quickly**, probably something **small** but affordable. He'd need to navigate job interviews, prove his **worth**, establish himself in a competitive field. There would be challenges, setbacks, moments when he questioned everything.

But there would also be opportunities. The chance to write stories that **mattered**. The possibility of making a difference, however **small**. The **interesting** **people** he'd meet, the experiences he'd **gain**, the person he'd become through it all.

He pulled out his **phone** and typed a text to Marcus: "On the train. Thanks for last night. I'm still scared, but I'm doing this."

Marcus replied immediately: "That's all anyone can ask. Go be great."

Alex then texted Sarah, Emma, and Jake in their group **chat**: "Officially on my way. Thanks for everything. I'll **miss** you all."

The responses came **quickly**: "We'll **miss** you too!" "Call us!" "Don't forget where you came from!" "Go show the city what small-town kids can do!"

He smiled, **grateful** for friends who understood both his need to leave and his **connection** to home.

Looking out the window, Alex watched Riverside disappear behind him. The train was heading northeast toward the city, but eventually it would **curve** **south** and then **west** through the suburbs before arriving at Central Station. The journey would take six hours—six hours to **transition** from one life to another.

He thought about the **meeting** he had scheduled for next week with a potential employer. The editor at The Metropolitan Voice, part of the independent **press**, had seemed interested in his portfolio. If that didn't work out, he had other applications pending, other possibilities to explore.

The **subject** of success and failure, which had kept him awake last night, seemed less daunting in daylight. He'd **act** with purpose and determination. He'd **accept** challenges and learn from mistakes. He'd move **forward**, step by step, building the career he'd always wanted.

Outside, a **sport** complex passed by, then a shopping center, signs of increasing development as they moved away from rural areas. The **size** of buildings gradually increased. They passed a hospital, then an industrial **plant**, evidence of the modern world expanding outward from cities.

Alex opened his laptop and began to write—not for any assignment, but for himself. He wanted to capture this moment, this feeling of being suspended between past and future, between fear and hope. The words flowed easily, describing the morning's goodbyes, his parents' faces, the bittersweet **quality** of leaving home.

Writing had always been his way of processing the world, of making sense of chaos. It was both his **talent** and his calling. And now, finally, he was moving **forward** to make it his life's work.

The train continued its steady progress, **carrying** Alex toward his future. His parents were miles behind him now, probably driving home to an empty house, adjusting to his absence. His friends were going about their days, pursuing their own paths. And he was here, in this **moment**, **accepting** the uncertainty and embracing the possibility.

It was terrifying. It was exhilarating. It was exactly what he needed.

As farmland gave way to suburbs, Alex closed his laptop and watched the changing landscape. Each mile brought him closer to his new life, to challenges and opportunities he couldn't yet imagine. But he was ready. Not because he had all the answers or because he was certain of success, but because he'd found the courage to try. He could **reduce** his anxiety by focusing on what he could control, taking each step as it came.

And sometimes, courage was **enough** to begin.
