# Chapter 8: Departure Preparation

Alex's bedroom looked skeletal, stripped of everything that had made it his. Two large suitcases stood by the door, packed and ready. A backpack sat on the bed, reserved for last-minute essentials. **Tonight** was his final night in this room, in this house, in Riverside as a resident rather **than** a visitor. The finality of it sat like a weight on his chest, making it **difficult** to **draw** a full breath.

He ran a mental checklist through his mind, trying to ensure nothing important had been forgotten. Clothes, toiletries, laptop, **medical** records, important documents—**each** item accounted for. His mother had helped him organize everything into categories, her systematic **nature** bringing **order** to what felt like chaos.

"You **ok** up there?" his father called from downstairs.

"Yeah, just doing a final **check**," Alex replied, though that wasn't entirely true. He was also trying to memorize the view from his **window**, the way afternoon light hit the oak **tree** in the backyard, the familiar layout of the neighborhood. **Simple** things he'd taken for granted for so many years. He could see the **top** of the church steeple in the distance, the same view he'd woken up to his entire life.

His phone buzzed—a text from Marcus: "Want to grab coffee **before** you go? No pressure, just thought I'd ask." Alex smiled and typed back affirmatively. One more goodbye wouldn't hurt, though **of course** each one made the departure feel more real.

He descended the stairs to find his mother in the kitchen, baking again despite having made enough food to feed a small army over the past week. It was her **response** to stress, he'd come to understand—staying busy, keeping her hands occupied.

"Mom, you don't need to make more cookies," Alex said gently.

"I know," she admitted, not looking up from the mixing bowl. "But it helps. Keeps my mind from dwelling on the fact that my only child is leaving tomorrow."

Her voice caught slightly on the last word, and Alex moved to put his **arm** around her shoulders. "I'm not disappearing. I'll **call** regularly. Video chats, visits home—**we'll** stay connected."

"I know that in my head," she said, wiping her eyes with a dish towel. "My heart is taking longer to accept it."

His father appeared in the doorway, carrying a **letter**-sized envelope. "Alex, I wanted to give you this **before** tomorrow's rush." He handed it over, looking slightly uncomfortable.

Inside, Alex found several sheets of **paper** covered in his father's careful handwriting—practical advice about city living, budgeting, staying safe. Lists of emergency contacts, including his father's old college roommate who lived **north** of the city. Suggestions for handling various scenarios that might **involve** everything from **poor** neighborhoods to avoid at night, to how to **answer** **difficult** questions in job interviews. There was even a **message** about staying **close** to his values no matter what pressures he faced.

"Dad, this is..." Alex's throat tightened with emotion. "Thank you. This must have taken you hours."

"Just wanted to make sure you were prepared," his father said gruffly. "**The city's** a different world **than** what you're used to. The **population** alone—millions of people instead of a few thousand. It can be overwhelming. People from every **race**, speaking every **language** imaginable. You'll need to adapt to that diversity."

"I'll be careful," Alex promised. "And I'll use this. Really."

They sat together at the kitchen table while his mother's cookies baked, the **smell** filling the house with warmth and comfort. Through the **window**, Alex could see the **park** across the street where he'd played as a child. Those swings and slides had been his whole world once. Now he was about to **trade** them for something vastly different.

"Can I ask you something?" Alex said, looking at his parents. "Are you worried I'm making a mistake? That this **plan** won't work out?"

His mother and father exchanged a glance, one of those wordless communications that came from decades of marriage. They understood each **other** completely.

"**Of course** we worry," his mother said finally. "That's what parents do. But we also believe in you. You're smart, **hardworking**, and you have good values. Those qualities will serve you **well** wherever you are."

"The **truth** is," his father added, "**there's no** guarantee this will work out exactly as you hope. Jobs can fall through, plans can change. But that's life. You **can't** let fear of failure stop you from trying."

"What if I **fail**?" The question had been haunting Alex for weeks, and now it spilled out.

"Then you **get back up** and try something else," his father said **matter**-of-factly. "**Failure's** not the end of the world—it's just information. You learn from it and adjust your **course**."

"**And** we'll be here," his mother emphasized. "Always. This isn't a one-way trip with **no** return. You can come home anytime you need to."

Alex nodded, feeling some of the pressure ease. The weight he'd been carrying—the sense that this decision had to be perfect, that he couldn't afford to make mistakes—began to **lift** slightly.

"I should go meet Marcus," he said, checking the time. "He wants to get coffee **before** I leave."

"**Tell him** we said hello," his mother said. "And don't stay out too late. You need rest **before** tomorrow."

"I won't," Alex promised.

At the coffee shop, Marcus was already waiting, two cups on the table. "Got you your usual," he said as Alex sat down. "**Figured** you'd need the caffeine after all the emotional goodbyes."

"You're not wrong," Alex laughed. "How are you doing? We haven't really talked since the diner."

"**I'm alright**," Marcus said. "Still figuring out the hardware store situation. Dad wants to **slowly** hand over responsibilities, which makes sense, but it's **difficult** to know if I'm **really** ready for it."

"You'll do great," Alex assured him. "You know that business inside and out."

"Maybe," Marcus said. "But it's **scary**, you know? Taking over something that's been **in the family** for three generations. What if I'm the one who **runs** it into the **ground**?"

"That fear means you **care**," Alex observed. "Which means you'll work **hard** to **do it** right. You won't **lie** to customers or cut corners just to **increase** profits. That integrity is what sets **everybody** apart from the big box stores."

They talked for an hour about their respective futures, about the fears and hopes that came with major life changes. It was easier to talk to Marcus than to his parents—there was **no** generational gap, **no** parental worry clouding the conversation. Just two friends facing the unknown together, even if their paths were diverging. Marcus mentioned the **worker** shortage at the store, how hard it was to find reliable help these days. Alex shared his concerns about the competitive **nature** of journalism, how many aspiring reporters were chasing too few positions.

"**I'll** miss this," Marcus said finally. "Just hanging out, talking about nothing and everything."

"Me too," Alex admitted. "But we'll stay in touch. And I'll visit. This isn't the end of our friendship, just a **change in** how it works."

"**I know**," Marcus said. "But **it's still hard**."

They parted with a handshake that turned into a hug, promises to text regularly, plans for Alex's first visit home. As Alex walked back to his house, he felt the bittersweetness of transition settling deeper into his bones.

Back home, he found his mother had finished packing care packages—cookies, his favorite snacks, even a small **photo** album of family pictures. "For when you're homesick," she explained, her eyes red from crying.

"**Thank you**, Mom," Alex said, adding them to his backpack. "I'll **treasure** these."

Dinner that evening was quiet, **each** of them **lost in their own** thoughts. His mother had made his favorite—lasagna—but **nobody** seemed particularly hungry. They pushed food around their plates, making small talk about weather and logistics, avoiding the elephant in the room. Alex tried to **enjoy** the meal, knowing it would be months **before** he tasted his mother's cooking again, but emotion made it **hard** to swallow.

After dinner, Alex's father suggested they sit on the porch together. It had **become** a family tradition over the years, these evening porch sessions. They'd watched countless sunsets from these chairs, discussed everything from school projects to world events.

"**I've** been thinking," his father said, settling into his usual chair. "About what you're going to **face** in the city. It's not just the **obvious** stuff—the **crowds**, the noise, the **pace**. It's the **cultural** differences."

"What do you mean?" Alex asked.

"**The city** has its own **culture**, its own **rhythm**," his father explained. "Different **than** here. People **move faster**, talk differently, have different priorities. You'll need to **adapt** without losing **yourself**. Crime rates are higher too—more **gun** violence **per** capita. The city **administration** is trying to address it, but progress is slow."

"That's **quite** the balancing **act**," Alex observed. "I **wonder** how people manage it all."

"It is," his father agreed. "But I think you can **manage** it. You've always been good at understanding people, at finding **common** **ground**. Just be smart about safety. Don't **drop** your guard in unfamiliar areas."

His mother had been quiet, but now she spoke up. "I know I've been emotional about this," she said. "And I don't want my worry to **burden** you. But I **need** to say something."

"**What is it**?" Alex asked gently.

"**Just**... don't lose your **humanity** in the pursuit of success," she said, her voice **thick with** emotion. "The city can be **competitive**, **cutthroat**. People **stepping** on **each other** to **get ahead**. Don't **become** that kind of person. Remember that journalism is about serving the public good, not **private** interests. You're there to shine light on injustice, not **cause** more harm."

"I won't," Alex promised. "You and Dad raised me better **than** that. I'll remember what really matters—**well**, I hope I will."

"We did our best," his father said. "But **the world** will **test** you. There'll be times when doing the right thing is **harder than** taking **the easy** way out. Times when your **integrity** will be **challenged**."

"I understand," Alex said. "And I **promise** I'll **try** to **make you proud**. **To stay true** to the values you taught me."

They sat in comfortable silence as darkness fell, listening to the familiar sounds of their neighborhood settling in for the night. The **song** of crickets, the **distant** bark of a **dog**, a car passing on the street—**all of it** so familiar, so much a part of home. Alex thought about how this small piece of **earth**, this tiny plot of **land** where he'd grown up, had shaped everything about who he was. Leaving felt like tearing away a part of his very **blood**.

"I should probably get some sleep," Alex said finally. "**Big** day tomorrow."

His parents stood with him, and they shared another embrace on the porch. His mother held him **tightly**, as if she could keep him there through **sheer** force of will.

"I love you both so much," Alex said, his voice **breaking**.

"We love you too," his mother **whispered**. "**More than** you'll ever know."

**Upstairs**, Alex lay in bed staring at the ceiling, **sleep** elusive despite his exhaustion. His mind **raced** through everything that could go wrong, everything that could go right, all the unknowns that lay ahead. What the **hell** was he doing, leaving everything familiar for a completely unknown future?

He thought about **the job**, about whether he was **really** qualified for it. About finding an **apartment**, **navigating** a city he'd only visited **briefly**. About making new friends, building a new life, finding his **place** in a world so much **larger** **than** Riverside.

But **mostly** he thought about his parents downstairs, probably lying awake too, grappling with their own emotions about his departure. The **sacrifice** they'd made over the years, the love they'd poured into raising him, all **leading** to this moment when he would **leave** them.

It was the **natural** **order** of things, he knew. Children grew up and left home. But knowing that didn't make it any **easier** for anyone **involved**.

**Finally**, sometime **after** midnight, **exhaustion** won out and Alex drifted into **restless** sleep, his **dreams** filled with **images** of **trains** and **cities** and the **bittersweet** **push** and **pull** between **past** and **future**.

When morning came, **everything** would **change**. But **for now**, **for** these **last** **few** hours, he was **still** home. **Still** the boy who'd grown up in this room, this house, this town.

And that, **despite** everything, **brought** him a **measure** of **peace**.
