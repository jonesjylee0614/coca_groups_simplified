# Chapter 92: Journey Home

Alex stood at the train station, watching commuters rush past him in every direction. The **coming** departure would take him home to Riverside for the first time in nearly two years—a gap that felt both **abstract** and achingly concrete. In his **purse**—actually a leather messenger bag, but his mother still called it a purse—he carried the award certificate and a stack of his published articles. Proof, perhaps, that leaving hadn't been the **unfair** abandonment his **sibling** had once accused him of making.

The digital **disk** containing his presentation for the high school visit rested safely in his laptop pocket. Margaret's suggestion to **mentor** young journalists had evolved into something more personal: a **stance** on giving back to the community that had shaped him. He wouldn't **hesitate** to admit now that Riverside deserved more than his absence.

His phone buzzed. A text from his father: "**Pickup** at 3:15? Mom's making pot roast." The simple message brought an unexpected tightness to Alex's chest. The **likelihood** of his mother cooking his favorite meal was one hundred percent—she'd probably started preparing it days ago, consulting **nutrition** labels and her old handwritten recipe cards with the precision of someone performing a sacred ritual.

The train platform had **improved** since his last visit, with new benches and a **shuttle** service connecting to the smaller stations. Yet the fundamental character remained unchanged—the same **dot** pattern on the tiles, the same overhead **lamp** fixtures casting yellowish light. Alex found himself watching for details, the journalist in him unable to **pause** even in this personal moment.

A woman dropped her **sock**—bright pink, surprisingly cheerful—and Alex picked it up, handing it back to her with a smile. She thanked him **thoroughly**, and he recognized the accent: Midwestern, flattened vowels, the same cadence as his own before the city had **filter**ed some of it away. He'd become his urban **counterpart**, someone who could code-switch between worlds.

As he waited, Alex pulled out his phone and scrolled through his notes. He'd been researching the **demographic** shifts in small-town America, the **residential** decline as young people left for cities, the economic challenges that communities like Riverside faced. The **calculation** wasn't simple: people left because opportunities were limited, but their departure further limited those opportunities. A vicious cycle that policy papers could describe but never truly **accommodate**.

A young mother nearby struggled with a stroller and too many bags. Alex moved to help without thinking, and she accepted with gratitude. "Thank you. I didn't mean to **exploit** your kindness, but my husband's deployed and I'm trying to get home to my parents for the month."

"No problem at all," Alex assured her. "Where's home?"

"Little town called Riverside, about two hours **southeast** from here. You probably never heard of it."

Alex couldn't help but smile. "Actually, I grew up there. Born and raised."

Her face lit up. "No way! Are you—wait, are you Alex Morgan? The journalist? My mom showed me your articles. She's a **believer** in what you're doing, always saying someone needs to tell the real stories."

The encounter felt too perfectly timed to be mere coincidence, yet here it was. They talked as the platform filled with other travelers, and Alex learned she'd been Emily Henderson's younger sister—Emily, who'd sat three rows behind him in Mrs. Peterson's English class, who'd moved to the city for college and never looked back. The small-town web of connections persisted even in absence.

When the train finally arrived, Alex helped her board, then found his own seat by the window. As the city began to **orbit** away behind them, buildings giving way to suburbs and then farmland, he felt the familiar pull of two worlds. The **gorgeous** skyline represented achievement, recognition, the life he'd built. But ahead lay the quieter landscape of home, no less valuable for its lack of skyscrapers.

He'd brought a **pillow** for the journey, anticipating the **faster** route might still mean uncomfortable seats. The train was newer than he remembered, with USB ports and Wi-Fi, small touches of modernity reaching even these regional lines. Progress came slowly to some places but eventually arrived.

Opening his laptop, Alex began writing. The words flowed differently here, suspended between destinations. He'd been planning to **undertake** a series on rural America, and already his mind was cataloging observations: the woman with the pink **sock** rushing to **catch** her connection, the tired father reading to his daughter across the aisle, the elderly man who boarded at the second stop carrying an old-fashioned briefcase.

Each person **comprise**d a story, a life as complex as any city dweller's. The **accusation** sometimes leveled at small-town people—that they were simple, backwards, less sophisticated—was not just **unfair** but factually wrong. Different didn't mean lesser, a lesson Alex had learned the hard way.

His phone rang. Diana Rodriguez, his colleague and **mentor**, checking in.

"How's the prodigal son feeling?" she asked without preamble.

"Nervous," Alex admitted. "It's been two years. What if everything's changed? What if I don't fit anymore?"

"Of course you won't fit the same way," Diana said bluntly. "You're not the same person who left. That's not **tragic**—that's growth. Your job is to **cooperate** with who you've become while honoring where you came from."

"That's very wise," Alex said.

"I know. I should write fortune cookies. Seriously though, don't **freak** out. Just be present. Listen more than you talk. Let people surprise you."

After they hung up, Alex reflected on her words. Diana had been right about everything else in his career; he should **regard** her advice seriously now. He'd been so worried about judgment, about whether Riverside would accept the version of himself he'd become, that he'd forgotten to consider what he might learn from simply observing.

The landscape rolled past, each mile bringing him closer to familiar territory. He spotted a **painter**'s van at a crossroads, bold letters advertising "Residential & Commercial." The driver waved to the train automatically, the same friendly gesture Alex had grown up with—wave to passing trains, to neighbors, to strangers even. Urban efficiency had trained that habit out of him, but maybe it was time to reclaim it.

His **jaw** tensed as he recognized landmarks. There was the old Miller farm, though the **rabbit** hutches he remembered from childhood field trips were gone. The elementary school looked smaller, its playground **innovative** equipment replaced by newer, safer structures. The water tower still proclaimed "Home of the Riverside Eagles," though the paint had faded.

He'd have to be careful not to **offend** anyone with assumptions. His articles about small-town struggles, while well-intentioned, might read differently to people living those realities. What seemed like advocacy from the city might feel like condescension to those who'd stayed, who'd fought to keep their community alive while he'd sought his fortune elsewhere.

The train slowed, and Alex felt his heart rate **compel** his attention. Through the window, he could see the station platform where his parents had waved goodbye two years ago, where he'd boarded with such certainty that he was escaping toward something better. Now he wasn't so sure the framework of escape and achievement was the right lens. Maybe it was **likewise** possible that leaving and staying were both valid choices, neither superior to the other.

As the train **pause**d at a signal just outside town, Alex caught sight of the river—the Riverside that gave the town its name. The water moved as it always had, indifferent to human coming and going, a natural **trace** of permanence in an impermanent world. He'd swum in that river as a kid, fished with his father on Sunday mornings, kissed his first girlfriend on the old bridge that spanned its narrowest point.

The **inmate** of his own ambition—that's what he'd become in the city, imprisoned by deadlines and bylines and the constant pressure to produce. Here, time moved differently. Not slower, as city people condescendingly assumed, but to a different rhythm entirely. Seasons mattered more than quarters. Harvests and holidays structured the year.

His phone showed dozens of unread emails, the city demanding his attention even as he traveled away from it. He could check them, stay tethered to that world, or he could let it go for a few days. The choice felt significant, almost symbolic.

Alex turned off his phone.

The train pulled into Riverside station, and through the window he could see his parents on the platform. His mother wore her **good** coat—the one she'd bought on sale at Penney's and saved for special occasions. His father stood with his hands in his pockets, the posture of a man trying to appear casual while feeling anything but.

They looked older. Two years had traced new lines on their faces, added more gray to his father's hair. The observation struck Alex with **tragic** clarity: time was passing, and he'd been absent for it. Phone calls and texts were poor **contributor**s to actual presence.

As he gathered his bags and prepared to step off the train, Alex took a deep breath. Whatever awaited him in Riverside—judgment or acceptance, change or stasis—he was ready to face it. The boy who'd left seeking validation had become a man who could offer something back. That had to count for something.

The doors opened, and Alex Morgan stepped onto the platform, home at last.
