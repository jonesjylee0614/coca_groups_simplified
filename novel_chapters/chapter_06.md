# Chapter 6: Family Dinner Conversations

The dining room table was set with their best dishes—the ones with the blue **color** pattern around the edges that only came out for special occasions. Alex's **mom** had been cooking since early afternoon, and the aroma of roasted chicken filled the house. This would be his last family dinner before leaving for the city, and everyone knew it carried weight beyond an ordinary meal.

"Let me help," Alex offered, watching his mother **cover** the serving dishes with aluminum foil to keep everything warm.

"You can **call** your father," she replied. "He's been out in the garage for the past **half** hour, tinkering with **whatever** project has caught his attention today."

Alex found his dad bent over the workbench, examining something on his laptop **page**. "Dinner's **ready**," Alex announced.

His father looked up, closing the computer. "Just checking the **current** news about that upcoming **election**. The **campaign** ads are everywhere these days." He stood and wiped his hands on a rag. "**Technology** has changed politics, hasn't it? When I was young, you learned about candidates from the newspaper and maybe a **video** or two on TV."

They walked back to the house together, his father's **arm** draped briefly over Alex's shoulder—a rare gesture that spoke volumes about the emotion of the evening.

Inside, the three of them settled around the table. The chicken sat in the center, surrounded by roasted vegetables drizzled with **oil**, fresh bread, and a salad. It was more food than three people needed, but Alex's mother had a **rule**: important occasions deserved abundant meals.

"This looks amazing, Mom," Alex said sincerely.

"I wanted to make sure you had a proper send-off," she replied, serving portions onto each plate. "Who knows when you'll get a home-cooked meal again?"

"I'll **catch** a train home for Thanksgiving," Alex assured her. "That's only three months away."

"Three months," his mother repeated quietly, the **term** seeming to stretch endlessly before her.

His father cleared his throat, changing the subject. "So, tell us more about this position. What exactly will you be doing? **Describe** a typical day."

Alex took a sip of water before answering. "Honestly, I'm not entirely **certain**. The **organization** is relatively new—it's an online news outlet focused on investigative journalism. I'll start as a junior reporter, which means I'll probably **cover** local stories, community events, that sort of thing."

"Sounds like a good **opportunity** to learn," his father said approvingly. "Starting at the **ground** level, working your way up. That's how I started at the plant."

"What about safety?" his mother interjected, her **face** showing concern. "Big cities can be dangerous. There's crime, and if you're out reporting stories at all hours—"

"I'll be careful," Alex promised. "The **director** of the newsroom seems very **patient** and understanding. During my interview, he emphasized that they don't **throw** inexperienced reporters into dangerous situations. There are **official** protocols for everything."

"**Uh**, that's good to hear," his father said, though he didn't sound entirely convinced. "But your mother has a point. You'll need to stay alert, be aware of your surroundings."

"I will," Alex assured them both. "And I'll **check** in regularly. I promise I won't disappear on you."

His mother dabbed at her eyes with her napkin. "I'm sorry. I don't want to **comment** negatively on your decision. I'm proud of you, truly. It's just hard to let go."

"I know," Alex said softly, reaching across to squeeze her hand. "This is hard for me too."

They ate in silence for a few moments, the weight of the impending departure settling over the table like a **third** presence. Alex looked at his parents—really looked at them—trying to memorize every detail. His mother's gentle expression, his father's steady presence. These were the people who had shaped his **character**, who had given him the foundation to pursue his dreams.

"Can I ask you both something?" Alex said, setting down his fork. "What was it like when you made your big **choice**? I mean, deciding to stay in Riverside, to **call** this place home?"

His father considered the question carefully. "It wasn't a **single** decision, really. It was a **series** of smaller choices that added up over time. After college, I had a job offer in Chicago—better pay, more prestige. But your mother was here, and the **community** mattered to us. **Looking** back, I don't regret it."

"Even though Chicago might have offered more opportunities?" Alex pressed.

"**Opportunity** isn't just about **career** advancement," his mother said thoughtfully. "It's about quality of life too. We wanted to raise you somewhere with clean air, good schools, neighbors who **care** about each other. That was our priority."

"And we've been happy," his father added. "Sure, maybe we could have earned more money, climbed higher on the corporate ladder. But **in terms of** what truly matters—family, **community**, peace of mind—we made the right **call**."

Alex nodded, understanding but also recognizing that his path might be different. "I hope you don't think I'm rejecting **all of** this," he said, gesturing vaguely. "Riverside, our family, the values you taught me."

"We don't think that," his mother said quickly. "We know you need to **test** yourself against the wider world. That's natural. That's healthy."

"Your generation has different possibilities **available** than we did," his father added. "The **international** nature of work today, the way **technology** connects everything—it's opened doors we never imagined. We want you to walk through those doors."

"But we also want you to remember where you came from," his mother said gently. "Don't lose **yourself** in the pursuit of success. Stay **grounded** in the values we've tried to teach you."

"I won't," Alex promised. "Those values are my **source** of strength. They're what will keep me honest when I'm reporting stories, when I have to **face** difficult ethical decisions."

His father brightened slightly. "Speaking of reporting, what kind of stories do you hope to **produce**? What issues matter to you?"

"That's something I'm still figuring out," Alex admitted. "During my interview, they asked about my interests, and I mentioned social justice, environmental issues, political accountability. But I **guess** I won't really know until I'm in the field, seeing what needs to be told."

"Just remember that every story has real people behind it," his mother said. "That's one thing living in a small town teaches you—everyone has a **face**, a family, a history. Don't let the statistics and the **campaign** rhetoric make you forget the human element."

"That's actually great advice," Alex said, making a mental note. "I should write that down."

"**Look**, son," his father said, his tone becoming more serious. "We want to **support** you in this, but we also need to talk about practical matters. Do you have enough money saved? What's your plan for the first few months?"

"I've been saving from my job at the bookstore," Alex replied. "I have enough for **about** three months of rent and expenses, assuming I'm careful. My salary starts **soon** after I arrive, so hopefully I won't need to dip too deeply into my savings."

"And if things don't work out?" his mother asked, voicing the fear they'd all been **dancing** around. "If the job doesn't pan out or you find city life isn't for you?"

"Then I'll reassess," Alex said honestly. "I won't see it as failure—just information. A **test** of what I really want. But I have to try, Mom. I have to take this **step** or I'll always wonder 'what if.'"

His father nodded approvingly. "That's mature thinking. Just know that if you do need to come back, there's no shame in it. This door remains open."

"**Whatever** happens, we're here," his mother emphasized. "Distance doesn't change that. You'll always have a home here, a place to **rest** and regroup if you need it."

Alex felt emotion rising in his chest. "Thank you both. I don't think I say that enough—thank you for everything. For raising me, for **supporting** my dreams even when they take me away from you, for being **patient** with my ambitions."

"That's what parents do," his mother said, though her voice wavered. "We raise you to leave us. It's the hardest part of the job, but it's how we know we've succeeded."

They continued eating, the conversation flowing to lighter topics—**recent** town gossip, updates about extended family, memories of past family dinners. Alex's father told a story about a **recent** town council meeting where the debate about whether to allow food trucks had somehow turned into a heated **fight** about preserving Riverside's **character**.

"People are **resistant** to change," his mother observed. "They want things to stay exactly as they remember, as if that's even possible."

"Change **itself** isn't good or bad," Alex said thoughtfully. "It's how we respond to it that matters. Riverside will change whether people want it to or not. The question is whether the town shapes that change or just reacts to it."

His father looked at him with evident pride. "Listen to you, sounding like a political **commentator** already. The city's going to be lucky to have you."

As they finished the main course, Alex's mother brought out dessert—apple pie, his favorite since childhood. The sight of it, golden and perfectly browned, threatened to undo his composure entirely.

"I remembered you loved this," she said simply, cutting generous slices.

"The **best** pie in the county," Alex said, taking his first bite. "Maybe in the **entire** state."

"Now you're just trying to make me cry more," his mother laughed through her tears.

As they ate dessert, Alex's father shifted in his seat, clearly preparing to say something important. "Your mother and I have been talking," he began, "and we want to give you something to help with the transition."

"You've already given me so much—" Alex started to protest.

"Just listen," his father interrupted gently. He pulled an envelope from his shirt pocket and slid it across the table. "It's not a fortune, but it should help cover unexpected expenses. First and last month's rent, security deposits—those things add up **faster** than you'd expect."

Alex opened the envelope to find a **check** for a significant amount. "I can't accept this," he said, though he was deeply moved. "You've already helped with my college loans—"

"Consider it an investment," his mother said firmly. "In your future, in your dreams. We want you to have a safety net, at least for the first few months. Don't **look** at it as charity—**look** at it as parents who believe in their son."

Alex felt tears gathering behind his eyes. "Thank you," he managed. "I promise I'll use it wisely. I'll make you proud."

"You already do," his father said gruffly, clearing his throat. "Every **single** day, you make us proud. This is just our way of showing we're behind you one hundred percent, **whatever** comes next."

The evening wore on, none of them wanting it to end. They lingered over coffee, told more stories, laughed at old memories. Alex tried to freeze the moment in his mind—the warm kitchen light, his parents' **faces**, the comfortable familiarity of home.

Finally, as the clock approached ten, they began clearing the table together. It was their established **routine**, one they'd performed countless times over the years. Alex washed while his father dried and his mother put things away, a choreography perfected through repetition.

"You know what I'll miss most?" Alex said as he handed his father a clean plate. "These ordinary moments. Not the big events, but nights like this. Just us, together."

"We'll have more nights like this," his mother assured him, though her voice suggested she wasn't entirely **convinced**. "Holidays, visits home—this isn't goodbye forever."

"I know," Alex said. "But it won't be the same, will it? I won't be living here anymore. I'll be a visitor in my own home."

"That's the nature of growing up," his father said philosophically. "Home becomes a place you come from rather than a place you live. But that doesn't make it less important. If anything, it becomes more precious."

When the kitchen was clean and everything put away, they stood together in an awkward moment of transition. The evening was ending, and they all knew that tomorrow would bring the final goodbyes.

"Well," Alex said finally, "I should probably get some **rest**. **Early** morning tomorrow."

His parents nodded, and suddenly they were all embracing, a tight circle of three. His mother was crying openly now, not bothering to hide it. His father's grip was firm, conveying through touch what he struggled to express in words.

"We love you," his mother whispered. "So much. Don't ever forget that, **no matter** how far away you go or how successful you become. You're our son, and that's what matters most."

"I love you too," Alex said, his own tears flowing freely now. "Both of you. Thank you for tonight, for everything. I'll carry this with me."

They finally released each other, wiping eyes and attempting to compose themselves. Alex headed toward the stairs, then paused and turned back.

"For what it's worth," he said, "I think you made the right **choice**, staying in Riverside. You built a good life here, raised a family, contributed to the **community**. That takes **character** and commitment. I hope I can build something half as meaningful, wherever I end up."

His father smiled, his eyes suspiciously bright. "Get some sleep, son. Big day tomorrow."

Alex climbed the stairs to his nearly empty bedroom, his heart full of love and gratitude and bittersweet anticipation. The dinner had been everything he'd hoped—a proper farewell, a celebration, a reminder of where he came from and who had shaped him.

Tomorrow would bring change and uncertainty. But tonight had given him something solid to stand on, a foundation of love and **support** that would sustain him through whatever challenges lay ahead.

He looked out his bedroom window at the familiar street below, the house lights glowing warmly in the darkness. This view, these people, this love—they would always be his **source**, his **ground**, his home. And that knowledge, more than anything else, gave him the courage to take the next **step** into his unknown future.
