# Chapter 45: Mental Health

Alex sat in the **parking** lot outside the therapist's office for twenty minutes, gripping the steering wheel. His hands were shaking. The **cable** news station he'd passed on his way here had been running a story about mental health stigma, which felt like some kind of cosmic joke. Here he was, a journalist who'd written countless stories about people overcoming obstacles, and he couldn't even walk through a door to ask for help.

The building was **beside** a small park where he'd eaten lunch once, back when he **still** had an appetite. That felt like months ago, though it had only been three weeks since the panic attacks started. The first one had come out of nowhere—a **sharp** pain in his chest while he was riding the subway as a **passenger** heading to an **interview** about housing reform. He'd thought he was dying, that something had ruptured **beneath** his ribs. The **physician** at the emergency room had run tests, checked his heart, examined every possibility. The diagnosis was both a relief and somehow more terrifying: anxiety.

"There's no physical cause," the doctor had said. "But that doesn't make it any less real. I'd like to **emphasize** that mental health is health. You should talk to someone."

Alex had nodded, taken the referral card, and tried to **bury** it at the bottom of his desk drawer. But the attacks kept coming. At his apartment, at work, even in the middle of writing a simple article. His editor Sarah had noticed him becoming increasingly **nervous** and distracted, missing deadlines that he used to meet with ease. The **atmosphere** in the newsroom felt different now—or maybe he was different, and everything else stayed the same.

He'd tried to **accomplish** what he always had, pushing through with sheer willpower, but this wasn't something he could report his way out of. This wasn't a mystery to solve or a **tale** to tell. This was his mind betraying him, telling him lies in his own voice: *You're not good enough. You're going to fail. Everyone's going to see you're a fraud.*

Alex finally got out of the car and walked toward the entrance. The office was on the second floor, above a café whose sign advertised "authentic **Muslim** cuisine from across the globe." The **recipe** board outside listed dishes he'd never tried—lamb tagine, lentil soup, flatbread with **pepper** and olive oil. His **habit** had become ordering the same **rice** and **vegetable** stir-fry from the Chinese place near his apartment, eating it **silent** and alone while scrolling through his phone.

When had he become this person? He used to be social, adventurous. His ex-**girlfriend** had complained about it toward the end—how he never wanted to go out anymore, how work consumed him **total**ly. She'd said he was using journalism as an excuse to avoid dealing with himself. At the time, he'd dismissed it. Now, standing in this **passage**way between his old life and whatever came next, he wondered if she'd been right.

The waiting room consisted of four chairs, a small table with magazines, and abstract art on the walls—the kind that looked like someone had thrown paint at a canvas and called it emotion. There was a **square** window that looked out over the **roof** of the café below. An **anonymous** person had left a half-finished crossword puzzle on the table. Alex picked it up, grateful for the distraction, but the words blurred together.

"Alex Morgan?"

He looked up to see a woman in her fifties with kind eyes and a welcoming expression. Dr. Patricia Chen. He'd researched her thoroughly before making the appointment—a **graduate** of Stanford's psychology program with specialization in anxiety disorders. Her credentials had **proof** that she knew what she was doing, even if he had serious **doubt**s about whether therapy could help him.

"Come in," she said, gesturing to her office.

The room was designed to feel safe. Soft lighting, comfortable chairs, tissues strategically placed. A **flag** from what looked like Tibet hung on one wall **beside** her diplomas. Books on **engineering** the mind, cognitive science, the **discovery** of different therapy modalities lined the shelves. There was even a small **cake** sitting on her desk—someone's birthday, probably, though she didn't mention it.

"So," Dr. Chen said once they were settled. "Tell me what brings you here."

Where to even start? With the panic attacks? The insomnia? The way he'd become **unusual**ly irritable, snapping at colleagues who were just trying to help? The **load** of stories he couldn't finish, the responsibilities piling up while he sat frozen at his computer?

"I think I'm drowning," Alex said finally. The admission felt like a **sin**, a betrayal of the strong, capable person he was supposed to be. "I've always been able to handle pressure. I left my small town, built a career, **gain**ed recognition in my field. I should be happy. I should be thriving. But instead I feel like I'm falling apart."

"**Surely** you know that success and mental health aren't mutually exclusive," Dr. Chen said gently. "You can **advance** in your career and still struggle with anxiety. They're not competing **territory**—they can coexist."

"But I'm a journalist," Alex said. "I **interview** people facing real problems—poverty, discrimination, violence. Who am I to complain about anxiety? I have my **liberty**, my health, a good job. It feels selfish."

"That kind of thinking is exactly what keeps people from getting help," Dr. Chen replied. "Pain isn't a competition. What you're experiencing is valid regardless of what others might be going through. In fact, reporting on difficult subjects can take a significant toll. You're not just observing trauma—you're absorbing it."

They talked for the full hour. Dr. Chen explained how anxiety works, how it's embedded in our **DNA**, an evolutionary response gone haywire in modern life. She described the **substance** of cognitive behavioral therapy, how they'd work together on identifying thought patterns and challenging them. She made him feel like this wasn't failure—it was a **discovery**, a **passage** toward understanding himself better.

"**Recovery** isn't linear," she said toward the end of the session. "Some days will be harder than others. But you've already taken the most important step by showing up. That's **immediate** progress."

Walking back to his car, Alex felt lighter somehow. Not cured—therapy wasn't magic—but hopeful. He'd expected judgment, but Dr. Chen had been matter-of-fact, treating his anxiety as something workable rather than shameful. She'd given him homework: tracking his anxiety triggers, practicing breathing exercises, challenging catastrophic thoughts.

He stopped at the café downstairs and ordered the lamb tagine, determined to break out of his comfort zone in small ways. The owner, a middle-aged man with a warm smile, served it with fresh bread and a side of **rice** pilaf.

"First time trying?" the man asked.

"Yeah," Alex admitted. "I've been in a rut. Eating the same thing, doing the same thing. Thought I'd try something new."

"Good for you," the man said. "The best **recipe** for life is variety, you know? Can't let **habit** trap you in one place."

Alex ate slowly, savoring each bite. The flavors were complex—**pepper** and cinnamon, sweet and savory together. He pulled out his phone and texted his friend Marcus from work: *Finally did it. Went to therapy. Feel like I can breathe for the first time in weeks.*

The response came quickly: *Proud of you, man. Takes guts. Want to grab dinner this week?*

*Yeah, I'd like that*, Alex typed back.

He thought about the stories he'd written over the years—the **host** of people who'd opened up to him about their struggles, their vulnerabilities, their journeys toward healing. He'd always approached their stories with empathy, never judging them for seeking help or admitting difficulty. Why couldn't he extend that same compassion to himself?

Dr. Chen had asked him to think about what he wanted from therapy, what **consist**ed of a good life for him beyond professional success. He'd been **silent** when she asked, realizing he didn't have an answer. He'd been so focused on the next story, the next byline, the next achievement that he'd forgotten to consider what actually made him happy.

His phone buzzed again. Sarah, his editor: *Hey, saw you blocked out time on your calendar this afternoon. Hope everything's okay. No pressure on the deadline—take the time you need.*

He appreciated her **straight**forwardness, her ability to read between the lines. She'd probably guessed where he was, what he was dealing with. Instead of feeling embarrassed, Alex felt grateful. He had people in his corner, even when he'd been pushing them away.

That evening, back in his apartment, Alex did something he hadn't done in months: he cooked an actual meal. Just pasta with **vegetable**s and olive oil, nothing fancy, but it felt like an accomplishment. He ate at his small kitchen table instead of in front of his laptop, actually tasting his food.

He pulled out the journal Dr. Chen had recommended and started writing. Not for publication, not for anyone but himself. He wrote about the panic attacks, about feeling like an impostor, about the weight of absorbing everyone else's pain through his reporting. He wrote about missing his hometown sometimes, about feeling untethered in the city, about wondering if he'd sacrificed too much in pursuit of his dreams.

The act of writing it down—just for himself, with no audience, no angle, no **proof** needed—felt freeing. This was his **tale** to tell, his truth to explore. It didn't need to be polished or publishable. It just needed to be honest.

Over the next few weeks, therapy became Alex's anchor. Every Wednesday afternoon, he'd park in that same lot, walk up the stairs, and spend an hour talking with Dr. Chen. They worked through his perfectionism, his tendency to **stir** up worst-case scenarios, his fear that taking a break meant weakness. She helped him see patterns he'd never noticed—how he sought validation through work because he'd never felt quite good enough growing up in a small town, how he'd turned achievement into his primary source of self-worth.

It wasn't easy. Some sessions left him exhausted, emotionally wrung out from examining his own mind so closely. But gradually, he started to feel different. Not fixed, but more aware. Not cured, but equipped with tools to manage the anxiety when it emerged.

He learned to recognize the warning signs—the tightness in his chest, the racing thoughts, the sense of impending doom—and to respond with techniques instead of panic. Breathing exercises. Cognitive reframing. Grounding himself in the present moment rather than spiraling into catastrophic futures.

The panic attacks became less frequent. He started sleeping better. The fog that had settled over his work began to lift, and he found himself writing with more clarity and purpose. Not because therapy fixed everything, but because he was finally addressing what had been holding him back.

One afternoon, after a particularly good session, Alex sat in his car and called his parents. His dad answered.

"Hey, Dad," Alex said. "I wanted to tell you something. I've been going to therapy. For anxiety."

There was a pause. "Are you okay?" his father asked, concern evident in his voice.

"Yeah, I am. Or I'm getting there, anyway. I just wanted you to know. In case you wondered why I haven't called as much lately."

"Alex," his dad said quietly, "I'm glad you're taking care of yourself. Your mom and I, we worry about you out there in the big city all alone. It's good you've got someone to talk to."

They talked for another twenty minutes—actually talked, about more than just surface-level updates. It felt good to be honest, to let his parents see him as something other than the successful son who had it all figured out.

As Alex drove home through the city streets, past the **square** downtown where protesters sometimes gathered, past the **parking** garages and office buildings where thousands of people worked and struggled and hoped, he felt a shift in perspective. Mental health wasn't something to be ashamed of or hidden. It was just another part of being human, navigating this complicated world as best we could.

He'd spent so much time documenting other people's journeys that he'd forgotten he was on one too. This wasn't a detour or a setback. This was part of the story—his story—and it was just as valid as anything he'd ever written for publication.

The path to **recovery** would continue, with good days and difficult ones, progress and setbacks. But for the first time in months, Alex felt like himself again. Not the perfect version he'd been chasing, but the real, imperfect, trying-his-best version. And that, he was beginning to understand, was enough.
