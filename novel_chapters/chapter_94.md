# Chapter 94: Family Reunion

Alex woke at **dawn** in his childhood bedroom, the same **sunlight** filtering through the same curtains that had marked his mornings for eighteen years. The room had remained largely unchanged—his mother's **protective** instinct to preserve it like a **sculpture** of his adolescence, frozen in time. Band posters still decorated the walls, and his old baseball **helmet** sat on the shelf beside debate team trophies and a **certificate** from the state journalism competition.

Downstairs, he could hear his mother moving in the kitchen, the familiar rhythm of cabinet doors and dishes forming a **drum** beat of domesticity. His father's voice murmured something indistinct, and his mother's laugh—light, musical—drifted up through the floorboards. The sound made Alex's chest tighten with something between **hunger** and homesickness, even though he was home.

He found them both in the kitchen, his father reading the newspaper in the **dawn** light while his mother assembled ingredients for what appeared to be an ambitious breakfast. A **jar** of homemade preserves sat open on the counter, next to fresh bread from the bakery and a **cart** full of groceries that spoke of planned abundance.

"You're **awake** early," his mother said, pulling him into a hug that lasted several heartbeats longer than necessary. "I thought you city people slept until noon."

"Old habits," Alex said, breathing in her familiar scent—lavender soap and coffee. "And I'm not a **bad** son, even if I've been gone too long."

"Never thought you were," his father said from behind the newspaper. "**Shy** about coming home maybe, but not **bad**."

His mother began cracking eggs with practiced efficiency, while Alex poured himself coffee and sat at the table. The morning light illuminated the room's inventory of family life: the **census** of photographs on the refrigerator marking graduations, anniversaries, and ordinary moments deemed worthy of display; the **tribal** gathering place where decisions were made and news was shared.

"Your award **certificate** came in the mail," his mother said, gesturing to the kitchen island where the journalism award document had been carefully framed. "We had it done at Thompson's Frame Shop. I hope that's okay."

"**Mmm**, that's perfect," Alex said, touched by the gesture. "You didn't have to do that."

"Of course we did," his father said, finally lowering the newspaper. "It's a significant **accomplishment**. We're proud, Alex. We always have been, even when we didn't know how to show it properly."

The **verbal** acknowledgment hung in the air, weighted with years of uncertainty and unspoken tension. Alex had left Riverside with his parents' blessing but also their anxiety, their fear that the city would **diminish** him somehow, that success might **transport** him so far from them that he'd never truly return.

"I know I haven't been the most **supportive** son," Alex began, but his mother cut him off with a wave of her spatula.

"Don't," she said **firmly**. "Don't apologize for pursuing your dreams. That's not what this is about. We just missed you, that's all. The house is too quiet with you gone."

"**Sadly**, I can't **delete** the distance," Alex said. "My work is in the city. But I realize now that I should have come home more often. I let my own fears get in the way—fear that you'd be disappointed in me, or that coming back would feel like failure."

His father set down his coffee cup with deliberate care. "Did we make you feel that way? That **level** of pressure wasn't our intention."

"No," Alex said honestly. "That was all me. My own internal **programming**, my own **conscience** telling me I had to prove something. I thought every visit home would be a **drill**, an examination of whether I'd achieved enough to justify leaving."

"**Fortunately**, you've figured out that's nonsense," his mother said, sliding a plate of scrambled eggs and toast in front of him. "You don't owe us **monetary** success or fame or anything except honesty and the occasional phone call. We're not keeping an **inventory** of your achievements to determine if we **comply** with some parental approval standard."

Alex looked at his plate, recognizing the **minimal** but perfect meal his mother always made when he was stressed—simple comfort food, nothing fancy. She'd remembered. Such a small thing, yet it spoke volumes about the ways love persisted across distance.

"Tell us about the city," his father said. "Not the **bad** parts we see on the news. Tell us what you love about it."

So Alex talked, really talked, for the first time without editing himself. He described the **marine** biology professor he'd interviewed who kept a **salmon** in a tank in her office to demonstrate ecosystem concepts. He talked about the street **performer** who played saxophone outside the subway station and how Alex had profiled him for a human interest piece. He mentioned the **influential** editor who'd taken a chance on him when he was just a **rookie** reporter with more ambition than skill.

His parents listened without interrupting, without the **protective** worry that had colored previous conversations. Something had shifted—perhaps his success had given them permission to relax, or perhaps two years of distance had provided necessary perspective.

"And what about your personal life?" his mother asked, refilling his coffee. "You mentioned someone named Jamie in an email last year, but then stopped mentioning them."

"That ended," Alex admitted. "I wasn't ready for a relationship. Too focused on work, too **shy** about vulnerability. It hurt when it ended, but it was probably for the best."

"**Sadly**, that's part of growing up," his father said. "You think you can control everything through hard work and dedication, but some things—love, family, connection—require different skills. They require you to be present, not perfect."

The wisdom surprised Alex. His father had never been particularly **verbal** about emotional matters. Perhaps he'd been growing too during these two years of separation.

After breakfast, his father suggested they take a walk to the river. Alex agreed, sensing this was more planned than spontaneous. They walked in comfortable silence for several blocks, past houses Alex had known his entire life, until they reached the riverbank where the water moved with timeless patience.

"I need to **clarify** something," his father said, watching the current. "When you left, I was afraid. Not of you failing—I knew you had the talent. I was afraid of losing you. That you'd become someone I couldn't understand, living a life I couldn't comprehend. That fear might have come across as disapproval, and if it did, I apologize."

"Dad—"

"Let me finish," his father continued. "I've been doing my **homework**—reading your articles online, following the issues you cover. I don't always understand the political complexities or the **census** data you cite, but I understand this: you're doing important work. You're being a **practitioner** of truth in a time when truth matters. That's not a **sole** achievement—that's a calling."

Alex felt his **threshold** for emotional control waver. "I was so focused on proving myself that I forgot why I became a journalist in the first place. It wasn't about awards or recognition. It was about stories, about people, about understanding the world as a complex **organism** rather than simple categories."

"Mrs. Peterson would be proud," his father said. "She always saw something special in you. She told me once that you had the ability to **spy** the truth in situations where others saw only surfaces. Said you'd either be a great journalist or a terrible gossip."

They both laughed, and the tension that had been coiling in Alex's chest began to unwind. His father reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a small wrapped package.

"This is for you," he said. "Consider it a belated congratulations on the award, though it's really more than that. It's a **reward** for staying true to yourself."

Alex unwrapped the package to find a vintage typewriter **key**—the letter "T" from his grandfather's old typewriter, the one he'd learned to type on as a child. His father had mounted it on a small wooden base with a brass plate that read: "For Truth."

"I saved it when we finally got rid of that old machine," his father explained. "Thought someday you might want it. Seemed like the right time."

Alex turned the key over in his hands, feeling the weight of three generations of storytellers—his grandfather who'd written local news, himself who'd taken it to a larger stage. "This means everything, Dad. Thank you."

"Just promise me you won't become so focused on big city problems that you forget about places like Riverside," his father said. "We have stories too. Not always dramatic or **ranking** high in national importance, but real nonetheless. People here are living organisms too—complex, struggling, hoping."

"I promise," Alex said. "In fact, I'm starting a project documenting small-town America for urban audiences. Trying to bridge the gap, help people see each other as more than **tribal** enemies divided by geography and politics."

His father nodded approval. "That's good work. Important work. Just remember to **pick** up the phone more often too. Your mother worries, even if she tries not to show it. Every time there's news about violence in the city, she imagines you in danger. It would help her **conscience** if you checked in more regularly."

"I will," Alex promised. "No more **harassment** of your mailbox with rare postcards. Actual calls, actual visits. I want to be part of this family, not just a memory in a preserved bedroom."

They walked back to the house in companionable silence, and Alex felt something settle inside him—a **molecule** of peace, perhaps, or simply the recognition that he could be both his city self and his Riverside self. The two weren't mutually exclusive.

His mother had spent their absence preparing Alex's favorite lunch—pot roast with vegetables, the same meal that had marked every significant celebration of his childhood. The **gram** of effort she put into each dish wasn't about the food itself but about love expressed through nourishment.

As they sat down to eat, Alex's phone buzzed. He started to **ignore** it—no, that wasn't right. He started to reach for it out of habit, but stopped himself.

"**Spare** your old parents the competition with that device," his mother said with gentle humor. "Unless it's truly urgent, the city can wait."

Alex turned the phone off completely and set it aside. "You're right. Nothing is urgent enough to **diminish** this moment."

They ate slowly, savoring not just the food but the conversation, the easy laughter, the shared memories and inside jokes that only families accumulate over decades. This was what Alex had sacrificed in his pursuit of success—not **monetary** wealth but the wealth of presence, of showing up, of being known completely by people who loved him regardless of his achievements or failures.

When his mother brought out dessert—homemade apple pie, of course—Alex found himself blinking back unexpected tears. His father pretended not to notice, but his mother reached across the table and squeezed his hand.

"**Fortunately**," she said softly, "coming home is always possible. The door is always open, Alex. Remember that."

"I will," he promised. "I will."
