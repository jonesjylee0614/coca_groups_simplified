# Chapter 46: Healthy Living

The **guy** at the gym's front desk looked up from his computer and smiled. "First time here?"

"Yeah," Alex admitted. "I'm not really **sure** how this works."

"No **question** about it—starting is the hardest part," the young man said cheerfully. He was probably twenty-two, wearing a **company** polo with a name tag that **read** "Tyler." "You signed up online, **right**? Let me pull up your account."

Alex stood **during** the registration process, feeling out of place among the athletic-looking people moving through the **city** gym's lobby. It had been years since he'd done **anything** resembling regular exercise. **Before** he'd moved to the **city**, he'd ridden his bike around Riverside, but that had been transportation as much as fitness. Since starting his **job** at The Metropolitan Voice, he'd spent **most** of his time sitting—at his desk, in coffee shops, on the subway. His body had become something he inhabited **without** really paying attention to it.

Dr. Chen had suggested exercise **during** one of their sessions. "It's not a cure for anxiety," she'd said, "but physical activity can help regulate your nervous **system**. Plus, it gets you out of your head for a while."

That had been a **month** ago. Alex had **read** about the benefits in health magazines and online articles—every **story** about mental health seemed to mention exercise as if it were some miracle cure. He'd been skeptical. How could **run**ning in circles possibly help with the existential dread that sometimes kept him up at **night**?

But he'd promised Dr. Chen he'd try. And honestly, he **must** admit, he'd noticed how **bad** he felt physically. His back hurt from hunching over his laptop. He got winded climbing stairs. He'd wake up feeling stiff and unrested. It was **about** time he took care of his body the way he'd started taking care of his mind.

"Okay, you're all set," Tyler said, handing him a membership card. "We've got a **program** for new members if you want. One free session with a trainer to learn the basics."

"That sounds good," Alex said. The **fact** was, he had no idea where to **begin**. He'd written plenty of stories **about** fitness programs and health initiatives funded by the **government**, but he'd never been the **case** study himself.

The trainer, a woman named Keisha, met him on the gym floor fifteen minutes later. She was energetic **without** being overwhelming, the kind of person who made fitness seem accessible rather than intimidating. She showed him how to use the machines, explained proper form, and designed a simple routine he could **work** on three times a week.

"The key is consistency," she said. "A **little** bit regularly is better than a **lot** sporadically. Don't **hold** yourself to impossible standards—just show up."

Alex appreciated her no-nonsense approach. She didn't try to sell him on some extreme transformation or promise he'd look **different** in six weeks. She treated exercise like what it was: something **live** human beings needed to do to stay healthy, nothing more magical or complicated than that. The membership wasn't cheap—more **money** than he wanted to spend **each** **month**—but his health was worth the investment. Besides, had he **ever** really invested in himself this way **before**?

After the training session, Alex changed in the locker room and headed to the park across the street. **Each** step felt heavier than it should. His legs weren't used to this. But he'd committed to trying, and Dr. Chen always emphasized the importance of following through on commitments to yourself.

The park was busy on this Saturday morning. Families with **small** children feeding ducks at the pond. An elderly couple walking hand in hand. A **number** of serious runners in technical gear moving at speeds that made Alex feel inadequate **before** he'd even started.

He pulled out his phone and opened the running app Tyler had recommended. The beginner's **program** alternated between walking and running—thirty seconds of jogging, ninety seconds of walking, repeated for twenty minutes. It seemed manageable. He could do **anything** for thirty seconds, **right**?

"Ready to **begin**," the app's voice announced cheerfully.

Alex started jogging. Within fifteen seconds, his lungs were burning. By thirty seconds, he was grateful for the walking break. This was humbling. He'd written a **story** last year about marathon runners, interviewed people who **run** fifty miles at a time for fun. He'd nodded along as they talked **about** runner's high and personal records, never imagining how difficult it would be to **run** for half a minute straight.

But he kept going. **Each** interval got a **little** easier as his body adjusted. Or maybe he just got better at managing the discomfort. **During** the walking portions, he looked around the park—really looked, instead of his usual habit of staring at his phone. The trees were starting to **bring** out new leaves. Spring was coming, though you wouldn't know it from the temperature.

A **friend** from **work**, Marcus, jogged past in the opposite direction. "Alex!" he called out, stopping and jogging back. "Since when do you **run**?"

"Since **today**," Alex said, breathing hard. "Trying to **move** more. Doctor's orders, sort of."

"Good for you, man," Marcus said. He wasn't even breathing hard, the show-off. "I do a loop around here **most** mornings **before** **work**. We should **run** together sometime."

"I'm not **sure** I could keep up," Alex admitted.

"Everyone starts somewhere," Marcus said with a grin. "No judgment. I couldn't **run** a mile when I started. Now I'm training for a half-marathon. It's like a **game**—you're just competing **against** yourself, beating yesterday's version. Best **word** of advice I can give: just keep showing up."

They talked for a few more minutes **before** Marcus continued his **run**. Alex finished his intervals, feeling both exhausted and oddly proud. Twenty minutes wasn't much, but it was twenty minutes more than he'd done yesterday or the day **before** that.

Over the **next** few weeks, exercise became part of Alex's routine. Three times a week at the gym, plus running in the park on weekends. It wasn't always enjoyable—**in** **fact**, **most** days he had to force himself to go. But afterward, he always felt better. Clearer. **Most** of the noise in his head quieted down when he was focused on just putting one foot in front of the other.

He started noticing changes. **Small** things at first—sleeping better, having more energy **during** the day. His anxiety didn't disappear, but it became more manageable. When panic started creeping in, he'd learned he could **run** it off, literally. The physical exhaustion left less room for mental spiraling.

One **night** after a particularly hard workout, Alex sat in his apartment and pulled out the journal he'd been keeping. Dr. Chen had suggested **write**ing down observations **about** how exercise affected his mood. He flipped through pages of entries, noticing patterns he hadn't seen **before**.

*Week 1: Felt ridiculous. Everyone at the gym knows what they're doing except me.*

*Week 2: Ran for a full minute **without** stopping. **Small** victory but it counts.*

*Week 3: Slept through the **night** for the first time in months.*

*Week 4: Marcus and I ran together. He's faster but patient. Might make this a regular thing.*

He kept **write**ing. There was something therapeutic **about** documenting his progress, seeing evidence that he was actually **move**ing forward instead of just treading water. Dr. Chen had been **right** **about** this, **about** all of it. Taking care of his physical health wasn't separate from his mental health—they were the same **system**, interconnected in ways he'd never understood **before**.

At **work** the following week, Sarah noticed the change. "You seem **different**," she said **during** their weekly check-in. "In a good way. More present."

"I've been **work**ing out," Alex said. "And going to therapy. Trying to figure out how to actually **live** instead of just survive, you know?"

"I do know," Sarah said. "I **love** that you're taking care of yourself. Too many people in this **job** burn out because they think self-care is selfish. But you can't pour from an empty cup."

She had a point. Alex had been running on empty for so long he'd forgotten what it felt like to have energy reserves. Now, with therapy and exercise, he was starting to rebuild them.

Marcus invited him to join a weekly basketball **game** with some people from the **city**'s media scene. Alex hadn't played basketball since high school, but he agreed. The **game** was informal, more **about** having fun than serious competition. Everyone was at **different** skill levels, from the semi-pro **guy** who'd played in college to the **book** editor who admitted she'd never played organized sports in her life.

"This is my favorite part of the week," confessed the editor, whose name was Patricia. "I sit at a desk all day **read**ing manuscripts. If I didn't do this, I'd go crazy. No offense to my **job**—I **love** what I do. But we're not meant to be sedentary."

Alex understood exactly what she meant. His **work** as a journalist was intellectually demanding but physically static. Hours at his computer, chasing **story** leads, conducting interviews. His body had been an afterthought, just the thing that transported his brain from place to place.

After the **game**, the group grabbed dinner at a nearby restaurant. It felt good to be social in a way that had **nothing** to do with **work**. The conversation ranged from sports to politics to the latest **book**s people had **read**. No one brought up deadlines or bylines or the **number** of clicks their latest piece had gotten.

"You should come out with us more often," Marcus said as they left the restaurant. "We do happy hour sometimes, trivia **night** at this bar in Brooklyn. It's a whole social scene if you want it."

"I'd like that," Alex said. For so long, he'd isolated himself, convinced that success required sacrificing everything else. But watching these people—journalists, editors, writers, all managing to have **job**s and **live**s—he realized it didn't have to be all or **nothing**.

The **next** weekend, Alex went for a longer **run** than usual. Five miles, which a **month** ago would have seemed impossible. His legs protested, but he **hold** steady, maintaining an easy pace. **During** the **run**, his mind wandered through the **story** ideas he'd been developing, but **without** the usual pressure. Something **about** the rhythm of running helped him think more clearly.

He passed by the neighborhood where he'd done one of his first assignments—the community garden **story** that had felt so important at the time. The garden was still there, thriving. The same elderly **American** woman he'd interviewed was working in her plot, planting what looked like tomatoes.

"You came back!" she called out when she saw him. "The journalist **guy**, **right**?"

"Just out for a **run**," Alex said, stopping. "Garden looks great."

"It's the **most** important thing I do **each** week," she said. "Gets me outside, keeps me **move**ing. At my age, you **must** stay active or you'll seize up." She laughed. "Plus, **nothing** tastes better than vegetables you grew yourself. Better for you than **anything** from the store, that's for **sure**."

They chatted for a few minutes **before** Alex continued his **run**. He thought **about** what she'd said—how the garden was her form of staying active, her way of taking care of herself. Everyone found **different** paths to the same destination: health, balance, sanity in a chaotic **city**.

That **night**, Alex called his parents. His mom answered, delighted to hear from him.

"You sound good," she said. "**Different** somehow. Lighter."

"I've been taking better care of myself," Alex told her. "**Run**ning, **work**ing out, eating better. It's made a bigger difference than I expected."

"I'm glad, honey. Your father and I have been worried **about** you. You **work** so hard, and we know that **city** can be stressful. Are you eating enough? Getting enough sleep?"

"I am, Mom. Promise. I'm actually doing pretty well."

His dad got on the phone. "Your mother showed me that piece you wrote last **month** **about** the housing crisis. Strong **work**, son. You ask the **right** questions, get to the heart of things."

"Thanks, Dad."

"Just don't forget there's more to **live** than **work**," his father added. "I spent too many years at that plant thinking my **job** was my identity. **Before** I retired, I realized I'd missed a **lot** of living. Make **sure** you don't make the same mistake."

"I'm trying not to," Alex said. "That's part of why I'm focusing on health now. Building a **live** outside of **work**."

After the call, Alex sat on his couch feeling grateful. For his parents' support. For **friend**s like Marcus who invited him into their lives. For the **little** victories—the runs that got easier, the anxiety that lessened, the sense that he was finally learning how to **hold** both his career ambitions and his wellbeing in balance.

He opened his laptop, not to **work** on a **story** but to **write** in his personal journal. Reflecting on the **month** that had passed since he'd started exercising regularly. The changes weren't dramatic—he hadn't transformed into some fitness fanatic or solved all his problems. But he felt more grounded. More present in his body instead of just existing in his head.

*The **most** important discovery*, he wrote, *is that taking care of yourself isn't separate from doing good **work**. They feed **each** other. When I **run**, I think more clearly. When I sleep well, I **write** better. It's not a matter of choosing between my career and my health. I need both.*

He thought **about** the **American** dream he'd chased to this **city**—success, recognition, making a difference through journalism. Those things still mattered. But so did this: the simple **fact** of being alive in a body that **must** be cared for, fed properly, **move**d regularly, rested when needed.

The **next** morning, Alex went for an early **run** **before** **work**. The **city** was just waking up, delivery trucks making their rounds, a few early commuters hurrying toward the subway. He ran at his own pace, not competing **against** anyone else's time or distance. This wasn't **about** breaking records or proving **anything**. It was just **about** showing up for himself, **each** day, doing the **work** of staying healthy.

As he ran past the park's entrance, past the gym where he'd go later that week, past the coffee shop where he'd start writing his **next** **story**, Alex felt something he hadn't felt in a long time: gratitude for his body, imperfect as it was. For legs that could carry him through the **city**. For lungs that—with practice—were learning to **hold** more air. For a **system** that was stronger than he'd given it credit for.

The sun was rising over the buildings, casting long shadows across the street. Alex picked up his pace just a **little**, feeling the burn in his muscles, the steady rhythm of his breathing. He wasn't running away from **anything** anymore. He was running toward something: a version of himself who could **hold** both his dreams and his health, his ambitions and his peace. A version who understood that you don't have to choose between succeeding and surviving.

You can do both. You **must** do both. And he was finally learning how.
