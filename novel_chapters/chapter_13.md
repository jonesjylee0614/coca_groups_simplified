# Chapter 13: Finding a Place to Live

Alex woke **up** on his **first** **day** in the city with a mission: **find** a place to live. The hostel was **good** for a few nights, but he couldn't afford to stay **here** long-term. He needed something permanent, or at least semi-permanent—a room **where** he could actually unpack his bags and start building a life.

He pulled **out** his laptop and opened the apartment listings sites Thomas had recommended. **As** he scrolled through options, reality hit **him** hard. The prices were staggering. Even tiny studios in questionable neighborhoods cost **more** than he'd budgeted. Shared apartments were **more** affordable, but still stretched his limited savings.

"**How** do **people** afford this?" he muttered to himself.

Thomas, already awake and working at his desk, overheard. "They don't, not **just** starting **out**. Most **people** have roommates—sometimes **two** or three **other** **people** in a small space. It's not ideal, but **there**'s **no** **other** **way** for most of us."

"**I** didn't **think** it would be this bad," Alex admitted. "**I** mean, **I** knew the city was expensive, but seeing the actual numbers..."

"**There**'s also the catch," Thomas continued. "Most landlords **want** **first** month, last month, and a security deposit **up**front. That's three months' rent **just** to move in. Plus, they **want** proof of income, usually showing you **make** at least forty times the monthly rent annually. **Which** means if you're **new** **here** without a job, you're basically screwed."

Alex felt his stomach sink. "So **how** **do** **I** **find** something?"

"**Look** for sublets or room shares **where** the main tenant is already established. Or **find** places **which** don't require **as** much documentation. They **exist**, but you have to dig. Also, be ready to move fast—**good** affordable rooms get snatched **up** in hours."

Alex spent the next three hours searching. **Here** was a room in Brooklyn—too far from potential job opportunities. **There** was a share in Queens—**more** affordable, but the listing mentioned "occasional mice." Another in the Bronx required he **give** **up** any hope of personal space; the room was literally a converted closet.

**As** the morning wore on, Alex realized this was going to **take** longer **than** he'd thought. He decided to actually **go** **out** and **see** some places rather **than** **just** looking online. At least **then** he'd get a real sense of what he was dealing with.

His **first** apartment viewing was at **two** in the afternoon in a neighborhood **just** north of the hostel. The building **look**ed decent from the **outside**—older but well-maintained brick construction. **When** he buzzed the apartment number, a woman's voice crackled through the intercom.

"**Come** on **up**. Fourth floor."

The stairs were narrow and dimly lit, but **clean**. **When** Alex reached the fourth floor, he **see**s a door open at the end of the hall. A woman in **her** thirties stood **there**, arms crossed.

"You Alex?" she asked.

"Yes, **that**'s me."

"**I**'m Rachel. This **way**."

She led **him** through a **well**-kept apartment to a small room at the back. It had **one** window overlooking an alley, a bed frame, and **just** enough space for a desk. The walls needed paint, but the **floor** was solid hardwood.

"Six hundred a month, utilities included except electric," Rachel said. "First and last month **up**front, no security deposit **because** **I**'m the tenant, not the landlord. You'd be sharing the bathroom with me and **two** **other** roommates—Lisa and Kevin. Kitchen is communal. No smoking, no overnight guests **more** **than** **two** nights a week, **no** pets. You **want** it?"

"Can **I** **think** about it?" Alex asked.

"Sure, but **I** have three **more** **people** coming to **see** it today. If you **want** it, you should decide soon."

"Can **I** meet the **other** roommates **first**?"

Rachel's expression softened slightly. "Lisa's at work, Kevin's **out**. But they're both **good** **people**. We're **just** working professionals trying to afford the city. Look, **I**'ll be honest—**there** are **more** polished places **out** **there**, but this is **clean**, **safe**, and **well**-managed. **Which** is **more** **than** you can say for a lot of places in your price range."

"Let me **see** a few **more** options and **I**'ll **tell** you by tonight," Alex said.

"Fair enough. **Here**'s my number."

The second viewing was in a **new**er building farther **out**. **When** Alex arrived, he immediately noticed something off—the building's entrance **look**ed **good**, but the hallways smelled strange. **When** he met the current tenant, a guy named Brad who was moving **out**, the reason became clear.

"So yeah, the landlord's kind of a dick," Brad said casually, showing Alex a tiny room with **no** closet. "He never **fix**es anything. The heat didn't work last winter—we had to **use** space heaters and **our** electric bill was insane. Also, **there**'s a **guy** on the **first** floor who parties until 4 AM most nights."

"**Why** are you leaving?" Alex asked, though the answer seemed obvious.

"**Find**ing something better. Or trying to. Honestly, **man**, my advice is to keep looking. This place will make you miserable."

Alex thanked **him** and left, crossing that option off his list. **How** did **people** **do** this? **How** did they **find** decent, affordable housing in this city? It seemed impossible.

His third viewing was back near the hostel, a room **some** **people** from an online housing group had recommended. The neighborhood **look**ed **well**-maintained, and **when** Alex entered the apartment building, an older **man** was mopping the lobby.

"You must be **here** for the room on three," the **man** said. "**I**'m Carl, the super. Good kids **up** **there**. You'll **like** **them**."

That was encouraging. Alex climbed to the third floor and knocked. A young woman answered—mid-twenties, wearing scrubs.

"**Hi**, you must be Alex. **I**'m Priya. **Come** in. Sorry **about** the **mess**—**I** **just** got back from a double shift at the hospital."

The apartment was small but thoughtfully arranged. Plants sat on windowsills, books lined makeshift shelves, and everything was clean despite Priya's claim of messiness.

"So **here**'s the room," Priya said, opening a door. "It's small—**I** **know** that. But it has **good** light, and you get your **own** closet. The **other** roommate is Jin—he's a graduate student, very quiet. We share the bathroom, but he's never in **there** for long. Kitchen is for all of us to **use**."

"**How** much?" Alex asked, though he **could** already **tell** this would be **out** of his price range.

"Seven-fifty a month. **I** **know** it's steep, but that includes everything—heat, electric, internet, even Netflix **because** Jin already pays for it. And the neighborhood is **safe**. **I** **come** home from night shifts at the hospital and never feel nervous."

Alex did the math in his head. Seven hundred and fifty dollars left **him** very little for **other** expenses. But this place felt right in a **way** the **other**s hadn't.

"**Why** are you renting **out** the room?" he asked.

"**Our** previous roommate **find** a job **out** of state. We need someone **because** we can't afford the place with **just** the **two** of us. And honestly, we're picky. We **want** someone **who**'ll respect the space, pay on **time**, not throw parties. Jin and **I** are both pretty focused on **our** careers—**I**'m working toward becoming a nurse practitioner, he's getting his PhD in environmental science. We **just** **want** a calm, functional living situation."

"**I** **think** **I** **want** it," Alex said, the words coming **out** before he could second-guess **himself**.

"Really? Don't you **want** to **think** about it?"

"**I**'ve seen **other** places. This **one** is the best. And **I** **also** **like** that you're both professionals with clear goals. That's what **I**'m trying to be."

Priya smiled. "Okay, **well**, **I** should **tell** you—we **do** have **one** **other** person coming to **look** at it in an hour. But **because** you're **here** **first** and you seem **like** a **good** fit, **I**'ll **give** you priority. Can you **come** back tomorrow morning to meet Jin? If he approves, the room is yours."

"What **time**?"

"**How** about **ten**? He should be **up** by **then**."

They exchanged numbers, and Alex left feeling cautiously optimistic. **As** he walked back to the hostel, he processed what had **just** happened. If Jin approved, he'd have a real place to live—not **just** a room, but a home with **people** **who** seemed grounded and responsible.

Back at the hostel, he ran **into** Thomas, **who** was making coffee in the communal kitchen.

"**How** did the apartment hunting **go**?" Thomas asked.

"**I** **think** **I** **find** something," Alex said, then corrected **himself**: "**I** **think** **I** found something."

"That was fast. **Where**?"

Alex described Priya's apartment and the neighborhood. Thomas nodded approvingly. "**I** **know** that area. It's **good**—**safe**, **well**-connected to transit, decent restaurants. Seven-fifty isn't cheap, but for what you're getting, it's reasonable."

"**I** have to meet the **other** roommate tomorrow. But **I** have a **good** feeling about it."

"Just don't get your hopes **up** too much. **Some**times the **other** roommate vetoes the **new** person. But if they **like** you, move fast. Places **like** that don't stay available long."

That night, Alex couldn't sleep. He kept **think**ing about the room, imagining **how** he'd arrange his few belongings, **where** he'd **set** **up** his desk for writing. He **think**s about **use**ing the kitchen to **make** real meals instead of eating **out** all the **time**. About having a stable base from **which** to job hunt and build his career.

But he also worried. What if Jin didn't **like** **him**? What if **some**one **else** swooped in with cash in hand and **take**s the room before tomorrow? What if he couldn't afford it long-term and had to move **out** after a month or **two**?

The anxiety kept **him** awake until nearly **two** in the morning. **When** he finally slept, he dreamed of endless apartment viewings, each room smaller **than** the last, each landlord **more** demanding.

He woke **up** at eight, too nervous to sleep longer. By nine, he was showering in the hostel's communal bathroom, trying to **look** presentable for meeting Jin. By nine-thirty, he was standing **outside** Priya's building, too early but unable to wait at the hostel any longer.

Carl, the super, was again in the lobby. "Back so soon? Must have liked what you **see**."

"Hoping to meet the **other** roommate," Alex explained.

"Jin's a **good** kid. Serious about his studies, but friendly **enough**. Keeps to **himself** mostly, **which** is **good** in a roommate. You don't **want** someone **who**'s always in your business."

At exactly **ten**, Alex texted Priya that he was **here**. She buzzed **him** **up**, and **when** he entered the apartment, a young Asian **man** stood in the kitchen making tea.

"You must be Alex," Jin said, extending his hand. "**I**'m Jin. Priya **tell**s me you're interested in the room."

"Yes, very interested."

"**Tell** me about yourself. What brings you to the city?"

Alex explained his journalism aspirations, his recent arrival from Riverside, his **hope** to **find** work at a **new**s outlet. Jin listened carefully, asking occasional questions.

"And you can afford seven-fifty a month?" Jin asked directly.

"For several months, yes. **I** have savings. And **I**'m actively job hunting, so hopefully **I**'ll have income soon."

"What if you don't **find** work right away?"

It was a fair question. "**Then** **I**'ll **find** temporary work—restaurant, retail, whatever it **take**s. **I** didn't **come** **here** to fail."

Jin exchanged a **look** with Priya. "Can you **give** us a minute?"

Alex stepped **into** the hall, his heart pounding. This was it—they were deciding his fate. He stared at a crack in the hallway ceiling, counting seconds.

After what felt **like** an eternity but was probably **just** **two** minutes, Priya opened the door.

"**Come** back in," she said, smiling.

**When** Alex entered, Jin was smiling too. "The room is yours if you **want** it. **First** and last month **up**front, move-in whenever you're ready."

Alex felt relief flood through **him**. "Thank you. **I** **want** it. Definitely."

They discussed logistics—move-in date, keys, house rules. Jin mentioned quiet hours after **ten** on weeknights, sharing cleaning responsibilities, respecting each **other**'s food in the fridge. All of it sounded reasonable, even comforting. **These** were **people** **who** **think** about **how** to live **together** successfully.

"**One** **more** **thing**," Priya said. "We have dinner **together** **some**times—nothing required, but if you're around and **want** to join, you're always welcome. We **think** it's **good** to actually **know** your roommates, not **just** **live** alongside **them**."

"**I**'d **like** that," Alex said. And he meant it. After **day**s of feeling alone in the city, the **idea** of **people** to **come** home to felt incredibly valuable.

He returned to the hostel to gather his **thing**s, his whole body buzzing with energy. **As** he packed, Thomas congratulated **him**.

"Told you it would work **out**," Thomas said. "**Now** the real work begins—finding a job, building your life **here**."

"**I** **know**," Alex said. "But at least **now** **I** have a base. A place that's actually mine—**well**, partially mine."

"That's all anyone has in this city," Thomas replied. "We're all **just** renting space and **time**, trying to **make** something meaningful before we move on to the next **thing**."

Alex moved **out** of the hostel that afternoon, carrying his **two** suitcases and backpack the **ten** blocks to his **new** home. **When** he unlocked the door with his **new** key, Priya was at work and Jin was in his room studying, but the apartment already felt **like** a place **where** he belonged.

He unpacked slowly, hanging clothes in his closet, setting **up** his laptop on the small desk by the window. Through that window, he could **see** a slice of the city—rooftops, a water tower, the edge of a park a few blocks away. It wasn't much of a view, but it was his.

**As** evening fell, Jin emerged from his room. "You getting settled okay?"

"Yeah, it's **good**. Thank you again for saying yes."

"Priya and **I** talked about it. You seem genuine, **like** you actually **want** to **do** something meaningful with your **life**. We can relate to that. Plus, she said you had kind eyes, and she's usually right about **people**."

They ordered pizza for dinner—Jin's treat, he insisted, as a welcome gesture. **As** they ate, they talked about their respective goals and backgrounds. Jin had grown **up** in California, **come** **here** for graduate school three **year**s ago, and planned to eventually work in environmental policy. Priya grew **up** in New Jersey, close **enough** to visit family but far **enough** to feel independent.

"What **about** you?" Jin asked. "What made you **want** journalism?"

Alex thought about **how** to answer. "**I** **think** stories matter. **I** **think** understanding each **other**—really understanding **why** **people** **think** and **do** what they **do**—**is** **how** we solve problems. And journalism, **when** it's **done** **well**, helps us **do** that. It shows us perspectives **we** might not otherwise **see**."

"That's a **good** answer," Priya said, having **just** arrived home from work. "The **world** needs **more** **people** **who** **think** **like** that."

Later, alone in his room, Alex lay on his **new** bed and allowed **himself** to feel proud. In **just** three **day**s in the city, he'd found a place to live—not **just** any place, but somewhere with **good** **people**, in a **good** neighborhood, at a price he could manage for **now**.

**There** was still so much to figure **out**. He needed to **find** work, build a **network**, prove **himself** in a competitive field. But tonight, in his **first** real home in the city, Alex felt **like** maybe he could actually **do** this. Maybe the **dream** wasn't **just** a **dream** after all.

It was a start. And sometimes, a **good** start was all you needed.
