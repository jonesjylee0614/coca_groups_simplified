# Chapter 4: School Education

The morning sun cast **light** through the windows of Riverside High School as Alex approached the familiar building. The **site** held countless memories—**perhaps** more than any other place in town. He hadn't planned this visit, but something had **pulled** him here on his second-to-last day home. He **needed** to see it one more time, to say goodbye to the place that had shaped so much of who he was.

The school looked the same, yet somehow smaller than he remembered. Students streamed through the entrance, backpacks slung over shoulders, voices chattering about weekend plans. Alex followed them inside, the hallways triggering a flood of memories.

He walked **along** the main corridor, passing the trophy case that displayed achievements dating back decades. There was his senior class **photo**, third row, fourth from the left. He'd been forced to **wear** that terrible blue shirt his mother had picked out, which he **still** remembered. A **couple** of his teammates from the debate team stood beside him in the **record** of that year.

"Alex Morgan?" a familiar **voice** called out.

He turned to see Mrs. Peterson emerging from her classroom. She looked older, with more gray in her hair, but her warm smile was exactly as he remembered.

"Mrs. Peterson!" Alex said, genuinely delighted. "I was hoping I might see you."

"Well, this is a **special** surprise," she said, gesturing toward her classroom. "Come in, come in. I have a free period right now."

Alex entered the English **department** classroom where he'd spent so many hours. The **space** was organized exactly as it had been **six** years ago when he graduated. Posters of famous authors lined the walls. Bookshelves overflowed with **novels** and poetry collections. Mrs. Peterson's desk remained in its **position** by the window, papers stacked in neat piles.

"So I heard you're **finally** leaving for the city," Mrs. Peterson said, settling into her chair. "Your mother mentioned it at **church** last month."

"Tomorrow morning," Alex confirmed. "I got a **position** at an online news outlet. It's not the New York Times, but it's a start."

"It's a wonderful start," she corrected him, her **voice** taking on that encouraging tone he remembered so well. "And honestly, online journalism might be more important than traditional papers these days. The **field** is changing."

Alex took a seat at one of the student desks, feeling oddly young again. "I wanted to thank you," he said. "For everything. You were the first person who made me believe I could actually do this—that I didn't **need** to be from a big city or have **less** doubt to succeed."

Mrs. Peterson waved off the compliment, but he could see she was pleased. "You did the work **yourself**, Alex. I just **saw** the potential and tried to help with its **development**."

"You did more than that," Alex insisted. "Remember that **project** you assigned junior year? The one where we had to write a feature article about someone in the community?"

"Of course," she said. "You interviewed the **former** mayor about his **role** in establishing the community center."

"That was the first time I felt like a real journalist," Alex said. "You gave me detailed feedback, showed me how to improve my questions, how to structure the piece. You spent hours helping me **because** you believed it mattered."

"**Because** you had something worth nurturing," Mrs. Peterson replied. "You know, I've taught English for twenty-**three** years, and I can count on one hand the students who had your natural talent for storytelling."

Alex felt himself blushing. "That's **quite** generous."

"It's true," she insisted. "You had—have—a gift for seeing the human angle in every story. That's what makes a **difference** between adequate journalism and meaningful journalism."

They talked for a while about his plans. Mrs. Peterson listened carefully, asked thoughtful questions, and offered advice based on her own experience. She'd worked briefly as a reporter before becoming a teacher, a fact Alex had learned during that long-ago **project**.

"The **price** of following your dreams is high sometimes," she said thoughtfully. "You'll face rejection, long hours, probably financial struggles. But the **price** of not following them is even higher. I speak from experience on that one."

"Do you regret leaving journalism?" Alex asked.

"No," she said quickly, then reconsidered. "Well, maybe a little. But I found a different **role**, one that **suits** me **fine**. I get to nurture young writers instead of being one **myself**. It's not what I planned, but it's been fulfilling."

A student knocked on the door, seeking help with an assignment. Mrs. Peterson excused herself for a moment, and Alex stood to examine the classroom more closely. He noticed a **movie** poster on the wall—"All the President's Men," a classic journalism **film** about Watergate. **On** the bulletin board, he noticed recent student work—essays and creative writing pieces. The quality was **pretty** good, he thought. Mrs. Peterson was still doing what she did best.

"Sorry about that," she said, returning. "Where were we?"

"I was just thinking about how this room hasn't changed," Alex said. "It's **nice**, actually. Comforting."

"Some things should stay constant," she agreed. "Though we did get new computers last year. **Federal** funding for technology upgrades. They're nothing **special**, but better than what we had."

Alex moved **toward** the bookshelf, running his fingers along the spines. "I must have read half these books for your class."

"You read more than half," Mrs. Peterson corrected with a laugh. "You were always asking for extra reading recommendations. **Especially** those contemporary journalism books."

"I still have some of them," Alex admitted. "In boxes, ready for the move."

"Good," she said firmly. "Never stop reading, Alex. The best writers are voracious readers. They **themselves** understand that you can't output good work without constantly taking in good work."

A bell rang, signaling the end of the period. Students began flooding the hallways, their voices creating a familiar cacophony of teenage energy.

"I should let you get ready for your next class," Alex said.

"Wait," Mrs. Peterson said, moving to her desk. She **pulled** open a drawer and retrieved a thin book. "I want you to have this."

It was a collection of essays by Joan Didion, well-worn and annotated in Mrs. Peterson's handwriting.

"I can't take your book," Alex protested.

"You can and you will," she insisted. "Consider it a going-away gift. Didion's work on observation and truth-telling... it's something every journalist should **return** to regularly."

Alex accepted the book, touched by the gesture. "Thank you. This means more than you know."

"Just promise me something," Mrs. Peterson said, her expression serious. "Promise you'll tell stories that matter. Use your **voice** for people who don't have one. That's the real **role** of journalism—to shine a **light** on truth."

"I promise," Alex said. "I'll do my best."

"That's all anyone can ask," she replied. "Now, one more thing." She pulled out her phone. "Let me get a **photo** with my star student before you become too famous to remember your old teacher."

They posed together in front of the bookshelf. Mrs. Peterson's assistant, another teacher passing by, took several **photos** to make sure they got a good one.

"There," Mrs. Peterson said, reviewing the images. "Perfect. I'll print one for my desk."

As Alex prepared to leave, Mrs. Peterson walked him to the door. The hallway was now packed with students changing classes, a sea of young faces full of possibility—future teachers, perhaps a future **leader**, future journalists.

"You know what I think about sometimes?" Mrs. Peterson said. "If I had stayed in journalism, I might have reached a **million** readers. Maybe more. But as a teacher, I've influenced hundreds of students over the years. It's not **either**/**or**—both paths have value."

"You've definitely influenced me," Alex said. "More than you probably realize."

"Good luck, Alex," she said, placing a hand on his shoulder. "Go make us proud. And don't be a stranger—I want to **read** your work, so send me links to your articles."

"I will," Alex promised. "And thank you, Mrs. Peterson. For believing in me when I wasn't sure I believed in **myself**."

He walked back down the hallway, past classrooms where teachers were calling students to order, past the gymnasium where he could hear a basketball **player** practicing, the ball making a rhythmic **hit** against the floor, past the cafeteria where lunch **was** being prepared. Each **space** held memories, lessons learned both in and out of the classroom.

Outside, Alex paused on the front steps where he'd stood for his graduation **photo** **six** years earlier. The **view** from here took in the student parking lot, the football **field** beyond, and in the distance, the **church** steeple that marked downtown Riverside.

He thought about what Mrs. Peterson had said—about using his **voice** for those who didn't have one, about the **effort** required to do meaningful work. She'd been more than a teacher; she'd been a **model** for the kind of person he wanted to become.

A group of students rushed past him, laughing about something. They were roughly the age he'd been when Mrs. Peterson first encouraged him to pursue journalism. Back then, the idea of working for a real publication had seemed like a distant dream, something that happened to other people, not small-town kids like him.

But Mrs. Peterson had seen something in him. She'd invested time and **effort** into his **development** as a writer. She'd helped **raise** his standards, pushed him to be better, refused to let him settle for mediocre work. She knew how to **pull** the best out of her students.

"Thank you," Alex whispered to the building, to the memories, to every teacher who had played a **role** in getting him to this moment.

As he walked back toward home, he clutched the Didion book in his hand. It felt like a torch being passed, a **relationship** between mentor and student extending into the future. Whatever happened in the city, whatever challenges he faced, he would carry Mrs. Peterson's lessons with him.

The afternoon sun **was** warm on his face as he made his way through familiar streets. Tomorrow would bring change, but today he was grateful for the **education** he'd received—not just in English class, but in believing that dreams were worth pursuing, that effort mattered, that one person's encouragement could make all the **difference**.

And that, Alex thought, was **quite** possibly the most important lesson of all.
