# Chapter 91: Career Achievement

The **carpet** in Editor-in-Chief Margaret Harrison's office was a deep burgundy, **running** the length of the spacious room and muffling Alex's footsteps as he entered. Through the **interior** windows overlooking the newsroom, he could see his colleagues pretending not to watch this unexpected summons. In his three years at The Metropolitan Voice, he'd learned that being called to the top floor could mean either spectacular **good** news or the **departure** of another position due to budget cuts.

"Alex, please sit," Margaret gestured to the leather chair across from her desk. A **graph** showing their website's traffic statistics was displayed on her monitor, and Alex noticed with satisfaction that several of his recent investigations appeared in the trending articles sidebar. "I won't make you do the **homework** of guessing why you're here. Your work this past year has been exceptional."

Alex felt his **pulse** quicken. Margaret wasn't one for empty praise. As he settled into his seat, smoothing the **cloth** of his jacket, he tried to maintain his **dignity** rather than appearing too eager. He'd learned that **compromise** in journalism often began when you seemed too desperate for advancement.

"Your series on the healthcare **subsidy** fraud **allegedly** committed by three major insurance companies has won the National Press Association's Investigative **Commentary** Award," Margaret continued, sliding a printed notification across her desk. "That's the **minimum** we expected after the public response, but what impressed the board more was your **continuing** commitment to stories that others wouldn't touch."

Through the window, Alex could see the city **spread** out below, a vast **continent** of stories waiting to be told. He thought of the late nights, the sources who'd risked their careers to speak with him, the documents he'd combed through until his eyes burned. The award was validation, but more importantly, it meant people were listening.

"We're creating a new **full-time** position," Margaret said, leaning forward. "Senior Investigative Reporter with your own weekly column. You'd have a research assistant, a dedicated expense account, and editorial freedom to pursue long-form investigations. On your **behalf**, I've already proposed this to the board, and they've approved it."

For a moment, Alex couldn't speak. This was what he'd dreamed of since his first day in the newsroom, when he'd been terrified and overwhelmed, just a kid from Riverside trying to prove he belonged. He remembered Mrs. Peterson, his high school English teacher, telling him to **contend** for what he believed in. She'd be proud to see this moment.

"The catch," Margaret added, because there was always a catch, "is that you'll be **serving** as a mentor to our junior reporters. We're bringing in three new hires next month, fresh out of journalism school, and they'll need guidance. Can you handle that alongside your investigations?"

"Absolutely," Alex said without hesitation. He thought of Diana Rodriguez, the veteran reporter who'd taught him to ask the hard questions, to verify everything twice, to treat sources with respect. Passing that knowledge forward felt right, felt necessary.

"**Good**," Margaret smiled. "Now, about your column. I want you to think beyond the traditional formats. We're launching a new multimedia initiative—print, podcast, and video. You'll need to work with our tech team on the **android** app integration and possibly some **alpha** testing of new features. The media landscape is changing, and we need to change with it."

Alex nodded, already mentally cataloging the skills he'd need to develop. The old guard at the paper might grumble about **diplomatic** journalists who could write, speak, and produce video content, but that was the reality now. Adapt or become a **fossil**.

"I've been reviewing potential topics for your first column," Alex said, pulling out his phone to access his notes. "There's a story about wage theft in the restaurant industry that I think needs attention. I've interviewed a **mechanic** who works **full-time** but can't afford basic healthcare, and several kitchen workers who **allegedly** had their wages stolen through various schemes. One chef described how she'd **leave** work after a fourteen-hour shift making **olive** oil infusions and **herb** sauces for wealthy clients, while barely earning minimum wage herself."

"That's the **sort** of story we want," Margaret approved. "But I need you to do a **screening** of your sources first. After the Richards case last year, we can't afford any credibility issues. Document everything, run it through legal, **insert** only verified facts."

The Richards case had been a painful lesson for the entire newsroom. A **supposedly** credible source had turned out to be a professional con artist, a modern **thief** stealing credibility rather than jewels. The resulting corrections had **hurt** the paper's reputation for months.

"I'll be thorough," Alex promised. "Actually, I'm developing a **questionnaire** system for source verification. It's helped me **safely** navigate some sensitive investigations."

"Excellent," Margaret said, making a note. "Now, I want to discuss the **ecosystem** of your reporting. You've done exceptional work on urban issues, but I'd like you to consider expanding your scope. There are stories in rural America that need telling—agricultural **subsidy** fraud, the **mortality** rates in farming communities, environmental issues affecting **cattle** ranches."

Alex felt a stirring of something he couldn't quite name. Riverside, his hometown, suddenly felt closer than it had in years. The small-town stories he'd left behind now seemed valuable in ways he hadn't recognized as a young man eager to escape.

"I've been thinking about that actually," he admitted. "There's a **syndrome** in journalism where we only cover rural communities during election season or when disaster strikes. But there are **continuing** stories about economic decline, loss of local newspapers, communities struggling with substance abuse and suicide rates that deserve **diplomatic** and nuanced coverage. It's the **elephant** in the room of American journalism—we claim to serve all communities but focus primarily on urban centers."

"Exactly," Margaret said with approval. "You understand the **attribute** of good journalism—it should comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, regardless of geography. Your small-town background gives you an advantage here. You can **contend** with complexity without condescension."

She stood, signaling the meeting was drawing to a close. "There's one more thing. We're doing a profile piece on you for the **electoral** season coverage—how journalism shapes **democratic** discourse. The photographer will want to shoot you both here and in the field. I know you prefer to stay behind the scenes, but this is part of the job now."

Alex suppressed a grimace. He'd become a journalist to tell other people's stories, not to become the story himself. But he understood the reality: in the digital age, readers wanted to know the people behind the bylines, to trust the face as well as the facts.

"I understand," he said, standing to shake her hand. "Thank you, Margaret. **Solely** based on merit or not, I appreciate your confidence in me."

"It's **solely** merit," she assured him. "Though I won't lie—having an award-winner on staff helps with grant applications and **subsidy** requests from foundations. Everyone benefits when **good** journalism survives."

As Alex left her office and crossed the **carpet** toward the elevator, he felt the weight of new responsibility settling on his shoulders. Through the **interior** windows, he could see the newsroom bustling with activity. Marcus was **allegedly** arguing with the photo editor about crop ratios, while Sarah Chen reviewed **commentary** pieces for the opinion section. This was his world now, his tribe.

Back at his desk, Alex found his colleagues had **supposedly** been waiting. Through the window, he could see a police **patrol** car moving slowly down the street below—a reminder of the criminal justice stories that still needed telling. Diana Rodriguez was the first to approach, carrying a coffee in each hand.

"So?" she asked, handing him one. "Are we celebrating or commiserating?"

"Celebrating," Alex grinned. "Senior Investigative Reporter. My own column."

"About damn time," she said, raising her cup in salute. "Remember when you started here, terrified to call sources? Look at you now—award-winning journalist with **dignity** and everything."

"Thanks to you," Alex said sincerely. "You taught me everything I know about this business."

"Not everything," Diana corrected. "I taught you the mechanics, but you developed your own voice. That's what makes the difference. You see stories where others see statistics. You find the humanity in the data."

Marcus joined them, having abandoned his photo argument. "I heard the news. Senior Investigative Reporter? Does that mean you'll finally stop eating lunch at your desk like some kind of **android** that doesn't need rest?"

"Probably not," Alex laughed. "Old habits die hard."

"Speaking of which," Marcus said, "we're doing drinks tonight at O'Malley's. No excuses. You're **serving** as the guest of honor whether you like it or not."

As his friends drifted back to their work, Alex sat at his desk and looked at the city outside his window. Somewhere out there, a small-town kid was probably dreaming of this moment, imagining their own **departure** from familiar places toward unknown possibilities. He thought about writing a **commentary** piece about that journey, about the **minimum** requirements for success being less about talent and more about persistence.

His phone buzzed with a text from his mother: "Mrs. Peterson saw your name in the paper. She's very proud. We all are."

Alex felt something tight in his chest loosen. He'd been so focused on moving forward that he'd sometimes forgotten to look back, to acknowledge the people who'd believed in him first. The **prophet** isn't honored in his hometown, the saying went, but maybe it was time to change that narrative.

He opened a new document and began typing notes for his first column. Not about wage theft—that could wait. Instead, he wanted to write about small towns and big dreams, about the teachers who encouraged and the parents who worried, about the **good** that could come from bridging the gap between rural and urban America.

The words flowed easily, each sentence a step toward understanding not just where he'd come from, but who he'd become. The **cast** of characters from his past **nearby** in memory: his father's quiet pride, his mother's anxious care, Mrs. Peterson's gentle push toward excellence, the friends who'd taken different paths but no less valuable ones.

As afternoon light slanted through the newsroom windows, turning the **interior** golden, Alex Morgan—senior investigative reporter, award-winner, and still just a kid from Riverside at heart—began to write his way home.
