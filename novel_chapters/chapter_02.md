# Chapter 2: Small Town Community

The morning **air** was crisp and clean, carrying the familiar scent of Mrs. Henderson's bakery at the **end** of Main Street. Alex decided to walk through town one last time, wanting to say goodbye to the people and places that had shaped his childhood. **Although** he was excited about the city, leaving Riverside felt like cutting ties with a part of himself he could never fully **explain** to **anyone** who hadn't grown **up** here.

"Alex Morgan!" a voice called out from **behind** the counter of Miller's **Market**. Old Mr. Miller, who must have been at least seventy but refused to retire, waved him over. "Heard you're heading off to the big city tomorrow!"

"Yes, sir," Alex replied, stepping into the small grocery store. "Thought I'd walk around town, say **thanks** to everyone."

"Well, **according** to what your mother tells everyone at church, you're gonna be a famous reporter someday," Mr. Miller said with a grin. "We're all real proud of you, son."

"I don't know about famous," Alex said, feeling his cheeks warm. "I'm just hoping to get my **foot** in the door somewhere."

Mr. Miller leaned on the counter, his weathered hands clasped together. "You **listen** here, Alex. This town has supported you your whole life. We all watched you grow up—saw you selling lemonade, delivering papers, working at the library. You've got a **strong** work ethic, and that's something they can't teach you in any college. You'll do just fine."

"Thank you, Mr. Miller. That means a lot."

"Now, don't be a stranger. You call your mama, you hear? And if you ever need anything, we're all here. This community doesn't forget its own."

Alex felt a lump forming in his throat. "I won't forget you all, either. I promise."

As he left the market, he passed the barbershop where he'd gotten haircuts since he was a **baby**. Tony, the barber, was sweeping up hair when he spotted Alex through the window. He came outside immediately.

"Alex! Come here, kid!" Tony gave him a firm handshake that turned into a hug. "Can't believe you're really leaving tomorrow."

"Me neither, Tony."

"You know, I've been cutting hair in this town for thirty-five years. I've seen a lot of young people **decide** to stay, settle down, work at the factory or the school. Nothing **wrong** with that—it's a good life. But **sometimes**, someone comes along who's meant for bigger things. You're one of those people, Alex."

"I hope I don't let everyone down," Alex admitted.

"Impossible," Tony said firmly. "You're a good kid with a good heart. That's what matters. Whatever happens out there, you **remain** true to your values. Don't let the city **force** you to become someone you're not."

They talked for a few more minutes about **local** news and upcoming events. Tony mentioned that the town council had voted to install new **security** lights in the park, and that the high school football team had won their last game. He also brought up the debate between the **Republican** and Democrat candidates for mayor—typical small-town politics that somehow managed to generate intense **interest** among the residents.

"Your father still **suggest** I **sell** the barbershop and retire?" Tony asked with a laugh. "I keep telling him I'd rather **cut** hair until I can't **reach** the top of anyone's head anymore."

"You know Dad," Alex said. "He thinks everyone should retire at sixty-five like he plans to."

"Well, we don't all **agree** on everything," Tony replied. "That's what makes life interesting. Say, did you **eat** yet? My **wife** made too much pasta last night. I could **pick** up the leftovers and bring them over to your house if you want."

"Thanks, but I'm okay," Alex said. "Mom's making a big dinner tonight."

"Of course she is," Tony grinned. "Well, you **pass** along my best to your parents. Tell them they raised a fine young man."

Walking down Main Street, Alex greeted Mrs. Patterson, who ran the flower shop, and stopped to listen to old Bill Thompson complain about the recent tax **rate** increase at the town hall meeting. At the diner, Sarah Chen—whose family had owned the restaurant for two generations—insisted on giving him a free slice of pie.

"You come back and visit, okay?" Sarah said as he ate. "Don't be one of those people who leaves and never comes back. We want to hear about your adventures, **receive** updates about your life. You're still part of this community, **even** when you're gone."

"I will, Sarah. I promise."

At the post office, Mrs. Rodriguez was sorting mail when Alex walked in. She'd been delivering mail to his family for over twenty years, and she knew everyone's business in town—not in a bad way, just in the way small-town postal workers do. She also served as an unofficial community reporter, sharing news about every **event** happening in Riverside.

"Alex! I was hoping I'd see you before you left!" She came around the counter to give him a hug. "Your mother is beside herself, you know. She's trying to be strong, but I can tell she's worried. She even asked me if I'd heard any reports about crime in the city—as if the whole **nation** wasn't dealing with the same issues everywhere."

"I know," Alex sighed. "I don't want to hurt her, but I have to do this."

"Of course you do," Mrs. Rodriguez agreed. "And deep down, she knows that too. It's hard for parents, though. We want to **support** our children's dreams, but we also want to **control** everything, keep them safe. It's not easy to let go. You know, I told her that if anything bad happens, you'll call and **report** it to them immediately. That seemed to help a little."

"I'm scared too," Alex confessed. "Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night wondering if I'm making the wrong **decision**."

Mrs. Rodriguez took his hands in hers. "That's completely normal, honey. If you weren't scared, I'd be worried about you. Fear means you understand what's at stake. But don't let it stop you from taking **action**. The worst decision is the one you don't make."

She picked up a package from behind the counter. "This came for you yesterday. Your **phone** case you ordered, I think. Might as well take it with you."

Alex thanked her and continued his walk. The police station, where Officer Davis had given him a stern talk about speeding when he was seventeen. The library, where Mrs. Foster had suggested countless books that had opened his mind to the world beyond Riverside. The park, where he'd played as a child and where, according to his mother, he'd declared at age eight that he was going to "write stories that everyone will read."

At the hardware store, Mr. Jackson was rearranging tools in the window display. He spotted Alex and came outside, wiping his hands on his apron.

"Alex Morgan. I heard you're off to chase your dreams."

"Yes, sir. Leaving tomorrow."

"Good for you." Mr. Jackson had always been a man of few words. "You know, my son left town twenty years ago. Went to California, works in computers now. We don't see him much, maybe once a year if we're lucky. That's the deal you make when you leave a place like this. The distance doesn't just affect you—it changes things for everyone you **love**."

Alex hadn't thought about it quite that way before. "Do you wish he'd stayed?"

Mr. Jackson considered the question carefully. "Sometimes. But then I think about what his life would be like if he had stayed. Working here in the store, probably. Good life, honest work. But he wouldn't be happy. He needed more than this town could give him. So even though I miss him, I'm glad he went. You understand what I'm saying?"

"I think so."

"Your parents will miss you terribly. This town will feel your absence. But we'll all be okay, because we'll know you're out there doing what you're meant to do. That has **value**, Alex. More value than you might realize right now."

As the afternoon progressed, Alex found himself walking slower, taking in every detail. The way the light hit the old courthouse building. The sound of the traffic light clicking as it changed colors—even though there was rarely enough traffic to **require** it. The smell of fresh-cut grass from someone's lawn.

He ended up at the high school, standing outside the building where he'd spent four years of his life. The football field behind it was empty now, but he could almost hear the crowd cheering, almost see himself in the stands with his friends, young and **full** of dreams that seemed both impossible and inevitable.

His phone rang. It was his mother.

"Where are you, honey? You've been gone for hours."

"Just walking around, Mom. Saying goodbye."

"Well, come home soon. I'm making your favorite dinner tonight."

"I will. Thanks, Mom."

As he walked back home, the sun beginning its descent toward the horizon, Alex felt the full weight of what tomorrow would bring. He was leaving behind a community that had raised him, supported him, and believed in him even when he didn't believe in himself. These people had given him the foundation—the **base**—he would build his life upon, whether he succeeded or failed in the city.

He thought about Mr. Miller's words, Tony's advice, Mrs. Rodriguez's encouragement. Each person had given him something—not just well wishes, but pieces of wisdom he would carry with him. They had taught him that strength comes from knowing where you belong, even when you choose to leave. That love doesn't require proximity. That a community's support doesn't end when you **drive** away.

Riverside wasn't perfect. It was small, sometimes too small. It could be boring, predictable, resistant to change. But it was home. It was the place where people knew his name, where his successes mattered, where his failures would be forgiven. Leaving it was necessary, but that didn't make it any less painful.

As he reached his house, he turned back for one last look at Main Street. The lights were starting to come on in shop windows, creating a warm glow against the darkening sky. Somewhere, someone was grilling dinner. A dog barked. A car drove by, the driver waving even though Alex couldn't quite see who it was.

This was Riverside. This was his past. And no matter what his future held, this would always be a part of who he was.
