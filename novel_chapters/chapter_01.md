# Chapter 1: Family Daily Life

Alex Morgan opened his eyes to the familiar sight of his childhood bedroom. The morning light filtered through the same blue curtains that had hung there for as long as he could remember. This was it—the last time he would wake up in this room as a resident of Riverside, the small Midwestern town that had been his whole world for twenty-two years.

"Alex! Breakfast!" his mother's voice called from downstairs.

He sat up slowly, taking in every detail of the room. The posters on the wall, the books stacked by his bed, the old wooden desk where he had done his homework all through high school—everything would soon be just a memory. Tomorrow, he would be on a train to the city, starting his new life as a journalist. Or at least trying to.

"I'm coming!" he shouted back, swinging his legs out of bed.

In the kitchen, his parents were already at the table. His father sat with his newspaper and coffee, a routine that hadn't changed in decades. His mother moved between the stove and the table, placing pancakes and eggs on plates with practiced efficiency.

"Did you sleep well?" his mother asked, though Alex could tell from her expression that she hadn't. Her eyes were red, and he knew she had been worrying all night about him leaving.

"Yeah, Mom. I slept fine," he lied.

His father looked up from his paper. "Big day tomorrow," he said simply.

"Yeah," Alex replied, sitting down at his usual spot. "I still can't believe it's really happening."

"You've worked hard for this," his father continued. "We're proud of you, son. You know that, right?"

Alex nodded, feeling a lump form in his throat. "I know, Dad. Thank you."

His mother set a plate in front of him, piled high with pancakes just the way he liked them. "You need to eat," she said. "You're too thin. I don't know if you'll eat properly in the city."

"Mom, I'll be fine. They have food there, you know," Alex said with a gentle smile.

"But will you cook? Or will you just eat junk all the time?" She sat down across from him, her hands fidgeting with her napkin.

"I promise I'll take care of myself," Alex assured her. "I can cook, you know. And I'll call you every week. Maybe even more than that."

"You better," she said, her voice cracking slightly.

They ate in silence for a few moments, the only sounds being the clink of forks on plates and the rustle of his father's newspaper. Alex looked at his parents—really looked at them—and realized how much they had aged without him noticing. When had his father's hair gotten so gray? When had those lines appeared around his mother's eyes?

"I'm scared," Alex admitted suddenly, surprising himself with the honesty.

His parents both looked at him. His mother reached across the table and took his hand.

"That's normal, sweetheart," she said. "Your father and I were terrified when we got married and moved away from our families. But you have to do it anyway. You can't let fear stop you from living your life."

"What if I fail?" Alex asked quietly. "What if I get there and I can't find a job, or I'm not good enough, or I just can't make it work?"

"Then you come home," his father interrupted firmly. "This town will always be here, Alex. We will always be here. But you have to try. If you don't go, you'll spend the rest of your life wondering what could have been."

Alex squeezed his mother's hand. "I'm going to miss you both so much."

"We'll miss you too," his mother said, tears now streaming down her face. "But we want you to chase your dreams. We want you to have more opportunities than we had."

His father cleared his throat, clearly emotional but trying to hide it. "Just remember where you came from, son. Remember the values we taught you. Stay true to yourself, work hard, and treat people with respect. If you do that, you'll be fine."

"I will, Dad. I promise."

After breakfast, Alex helped his mother with the dishes while his father went out to the garage to fix something. This, too, was their routine—his mother washing, Alex drying and putting things away. They moved in synchronized steps, a dance they had performed thousands of times.

"You know," his mother said as she handed him a plate, "when you were little, you used to tell me about all the places you wanted to go and things you wanted to see. You had such big dreams, even then."

"I remember," Alex said. "You and Dad always encouraged me. Even when it seemed impossible."

"Nothing is impossible if you want it badly enough," she replied. "That's what I believe. And I believe in you, Alex. You're going to do great things."

Alex put down the dish towel and hugged his mother tightly. She held him like she used to when he was small, and for a moment, he was that child again, safe in her arms, not worried about the future or what would happen next.

"Thank you, Mom," he whispered. "For everything."

That afternoon, Alex walked through the house, saying goodbye to rooms and memories. He paused in the living room, where he and his father had watched football games every Sunday. He lingered in the hallway, looking at the framed photos that documented his life—birthday parties, school plays, graduation. Each picture was a moment frozen in time, a reminder of who he had been and how he had gotten to this point.

In the evening, the three of them sat together on the porch, watching the sunset paint the sky in shades of orange and pink. They didn't say much. There wasn't much left to say. But being together, in this moment, was enough.

As darkness fell, Alex's father stood up and stretched. "Well, I suppose we should all get some rest. Long day ahead tomorrow."

They went inside, each to their own room. But before Alex closed his door, his father appeared in the hallway.

"Son?" he called softly.

"Yeah, Dad?"

"I love you. You know that, right?"

Alex felt tears prick his eyes. His father wasn't one for emotional declarations. "I love you too, Dad."

His father nodded once, then turned and walked away, leaving Alex standing in his doorway, overwhelmed by gratitude and sadness and excitement all mixed together.

He lay in bed that night, unable to sleep despite his exhaustion. Tomorrow, everything would change. Tomorrow, he would step onto that train and into a future he couldn't predict. But tonight, he was still here, still home, still the small-town boy who dreamed of bigger things.

And in that moment, surrounded by the familiar darkness of his childhood room, Alex made a silent promise to himself. He would make his parents proud. He would work hard, stay honest, and never forget where he came from. No matter what happened in the city, no matter how much he changed, this place and these people would always be part of who he was.

The house settled into quiet, and finally, Alex drifted off to sleep, his last thought being a simple one: *Tomorrow, my real life begins.*
