# Chapter 93: Small Town Changes

The morning after his arrival, Alex walked through downtown Riverside alone, declining his mother's offer to accompany him. He needed to **survey** the changes with his own eyes, without the **shield** of family commentary. The **passing** of two years had seemed both infinite and instant from the city, but here the alterations were visible, tangible, impossible to ignore.

Henderson's Hardware, where he'd bought supplies for school projects and fishing gear with his father, had **cease**d operations. A faded "Going Out of Business" sign still hung in the window, sun-bleached and forgotten. The **removal** of such a cornerstone business **exhibit**ed the larger economic forces at work. In the **meantime**, no new tenant had emerged to fill the space. The empty storefront stood as a silent testament to changes Alex had read about in demographic reports but never quite **conceive**d in personal terms.

He stopped at the **pond** in Central Park, where ducks still congregated expectantly, waiting for someone to **feed** them. A mother and her young daughter tossed bread crumbs, and Alex felt **mentally** transported to his own childhood, performing the same ritual with his grandmother. Some things persisted while others seemed to **vanish** entirely.

The old movie theater had been converted into what appeared to be a community center. A **graphic** banner announced "Riverside Community Hub—All Welcome." Through the window, Alex could see yoga mats **combined** with folding chairs, a space trying to serve multiple purposes. The **model** of adaptive reuse made economic sense, but he mourned the **beloved** theater where he'd watched summer blockbusters and held his first girlfriend's hand in the dark.

"Alex Morgan, is that really you?"

He turned to find Mrs. Chen from Chen's Grocery, though the store behind her now bore a different name. "Mrs. Chen! It's so good to see you."

"We **left** the grocery business last year," she explained, reading the question in his eyes. "Health problems, and honestly, we couldn't compete with the big chains anymore. The **position** was no longer sustainable. **Capitalism** works differently when you're the little guy."

They talked for several minutes, and Alex learned that the Chens had sold to a regional chain that **poorly** understood the community's needs. The new management had discontinued the practice of extending credit to families in hard times, a tradition that had made Chen's Grocery more than just a store. It had been a social institution, and its functional **removal** despite the building's continued operation represented a loss that couldn't be captured in economic data alone.

Walking on, Alex noted the new coffee shop that had opened on Main Street—Third Wave Coffee, with a minimalist aesthetic that seemed **alien** to Riverside's **traditionally** ornate storefronts. Through the window, he could see young people on laptops, a scene that would have been impossible five years ago when reliable internet was still scarce. The changes didn't all **stem** from decline; some represented evolution, adaptation, new possibilities.

At the town square, a farmers' market was in full swing, a **gathering** that Alex didn't remember from his youth. Local **vendor**s sold produce, honey, handmade soaps, and baked goods. One booth belonged to a family that **presumably** owned the organic farm that had started up on the old Morrison property. The **popularity** of farm-to-table movements had reached even Riverside, creating niches for those willing to **opt** into alternative agricultural **model**s.

He stopped at a booth selling homemade pies, run by a woman about his age with kind eyes and flour on her apron. "You look familiar," she said, squinting at him. "Did you go to Riverside High?"

"Class of 2015," Alex confirmed. "I'm Alex Morgan."

"Oh my God, the journalist! I'm Sarah Patterson—well, Sarah Kim now. We had chemistry together junior year. You were Mrs. Peterson's **darling** student—she talked about you constantly after you left."

They caught up while she served customers, and Alex learned she'd married Tommy Kim, who'd been two grades ahead of them, and they'd started the pie business after Tommy lost his factory job. "We were **anxious** at first," she admitted, "but it's working out. People want quality, handmade goods. We can't compete on price with Walmart, so we compete on story, on connection. Tommy was devastated when the factory closure came—felt like life had **kick**ed him when he was down. But this business gave us both a new purpose."

Alex bought a cherry pie—his father's favorite—and continued his walk. The elementary school had received fresh paint but looked smaller than he remembered, a common **illusion** of returning adults. The playground equipment was newer, more colorful, meeting modern safety standards that **required** extensive padding beneath every structure.

Near the school, he passed a house with a garden that would have made his grandmother weep with joy. Tomatoes climbed trellises, herbs **firmly** established in neat rows, and what looked like experimental crops sprouted in careful plots. An elderly **Arab** gentleman worked among the plants, and Alex recognized the **instructional** care of someone who understood agriculture deeply.

"Beautiful garden," Alex called out.

The man smiled, straightening with evident effort. "Thank you. I grow what I cannot buy here—za'atar, sumac, proper cilantro. The **fork** you find in stores is not the same." He introduced himself as Mr. Al-Rashid, a professor who'd retired to Riverside after teaching Middle Eastern Studies at the state university. His daughter had married a local farmer, and he'd followed, bringing his knowledge and traditions to new soil.

"Do people ever give you trouble?" Alex asked carefully, thinking of the political climate, the way fear could make people **openly** hostile to those they perceived as different.

"Some did at first," Mr. Al-Rashid acknowledged. "One man told me to go back where I came from—**racist** words that were meant to **interfere** with my life here. But I **firmly** believe in **gathering** people together. I teach gardening classes at the library, free to anyone. I cook for community dinners. When you **feed** people, when you share knowledge, suspicions tend to **sink** away. Not always, not with everyone. But mostly."

The conversation stayed with Alex as he continued walking. Change in Riverside wasn't one-directional. Some **position**s had been lost, some traditions had **vanish**ed, but new ones were being **conceive**d. The town wasn't dying so much as transforming, though not everyone agreed about whether that transformation was positive.

At the library—his childhood sanctuary—Alex found evidence of that tension. A community bulletin board displayed various notices, and he could see competing visions for Riverside's future. One flyer **authorize**d a town hall meeting about attracting new industry. Another advertised a talk on "Preserving Small Town Values in Changing Times." The **clause** buried in that seemingly **neutral** title suggested resistance to certain types of change.

Inside, the library had modernized considerably. Computer stations occupied what had been the periodicals section, and a **cartoon** character **shield** promoted the new digital literacy program. The children's section had been reorganized with lower shelves and a reading **pond**—actually a circular cushioned area designed to mimic sitting by water. Innovation thrived here, adapted to local scale.

He found the head librarian, Ms. Rodriguez, still at her **position** after all these years. "Alex! Your mother said you might **stay** in town for a few days. Are you here to research something?"

"Just observing," he said honestly. "Trying to understand how the place has changed."

"Then let me show you something," she said, leading him to a new section labeled "Local Digital Archive." Someone—perhaps **firmly** motivated volunteers—had been scanning historical documents, photos, and newspapers, creating a searchable database of Riverside's history. "We got a grant from the state historical society. Your old teacher, Mrs. Peterson, spearheaded it before she retired."

Alex spent an hour browsing the archive, seeing his hometown's **passing** through time. Photos from the 1950s showed Main Street bustling with activity, every storefront occupied. The 1980s brought the first closures after the textile mill shut down. The 2000s showed attempts at revitalization, some successful, others not. The **graphic** timeline made clear that Riverside had always been changing; his generation hadn't invented the exodus or the struggle.

Outside again, Alex walked toward the river, the town's namesake. The path had been **improved**—no, that wasn't one of today's words. The path had been upgraded with proper signage and benches, part of a modest tourism initiative. A sign proclaimed Riverside "Iowa's Hidden Gem," though Alex suspected the **popularity** of the campaign remained more aspirational than actual.

At the old bridge, he found graffiti that hadn't been there before—not vandalism but a mural, **combined** images of past and present. Farmers and factory workers stood alongside laptop users and artists. The imagery attempted to **conceive** of a future that honored all paths, all contributions. Someone had spray-painted an **arrow** pointing toward the water with the words "Still Flowing" underneath.

A jogger passed—someone Alex didn't recognize, which itself was notable. **Presumably** a newcomer, someone who'd chosen Riverside despite or perhaps because of its small size. Not everyone was leaving; some were **descend**ing upon smaller communities seeking affordability, slower pace, different values. The flow went both directions.

His phone buzzed. A text from Diana: "How's the homecoming going? Getting material for that rural America series?"

He typed back: "It's complicated. Nothing is simple—not the changes, not my feelings about them. Both loss and growth happening simultaneously."

"That's called life, kid. Also called a good story. **Preach** complexity, not simple narratives."

Alex pocked his phone and sat on a bench overlooking the river. A **fever** of nostalgia had driven him here, expecting either total stagnation or complete transformation. The reality—a **combined** state of persistence and change—was harder to process but more truthful.

He thought about the articles he'd written from the city, well-intentioned but perhaps incomplete. He'd documented problems without fully understanding resilience. He'd mourned closures without seeing new beginnings. The **instructional** value of this visit was already clear: physical presence revealed what data **conceive**d **poorly**.

As sunset approached, Alex walked back toward his parents' house, past the high school where, in two days, he'd give his talk to students. What would he tell them? That leaving was right? That **stay**ing was wrong? Both **position**s felt too absolute, too **firmly** stated when reality offered such nuance.

He would tell them the truth: that there were many ways to live a meaningful life, that Riverside and cities both mattered, that the **illusion** of a single correct path had harmed his generation. He would **openly** acknowledge his own conflicted feelings, his sense that success in the city had cost him something he was only now beginning to understand.

The town that had once felt like a cage now seemed more complex—still flawed, still struggling, but also adaptive, creative, stubbornly persistent. Henderson's Hardware might have closed, but Mr. Al-Rashid's garden grew. The movie theater was gone, but the community center served new purposes. Some traditions would **cease**, others would **vanish**, but in the spaces **left** behind, new stories were being written.

Alex Morgan, award-winning journalist, was finally learning to read them.
