# Chapter 96: Sharing and Mentoring

The auditorium clock showed 10:00 **o'clock** when Alex arrived at Riverside High, thirty minutes before his scheduled talk. The familiar halls seemed narrower than he remembered, the **grid** of lockers and classrooms that had once felt vast now compact and manageable. A student passed carrying an **iPad**, technology that hadn't existed during Alex's time here—a reminder of how quickly the world was **rolling** forward.

Mrs. Peterson met him in the lobby, her hair grayer than he remembered but her smile unchanged. "Alex! It's so wonderful to see you. The students are buzzing with **curiosity** about your visit. We don't often get such accomplished speakers."

"I wouldn't call myself accomplished," Alex demurred. "I'm still learning, still figuring things out."

"That's exactly what they need to hear," she said, leading him toward the auditorium. "Not **denial** of your success, but honest **disclosure** about the journey. Too many young people think success strikes like **lightning**—sudden and magical. They need to understand it's more like a **turtle**'s progress—slow, steady, **challenging** but achievable."

The auditorium was filling with students, their voices creating a **flood** of sound that brought back visceral memories of assemblies and performances. Alex felt his **ambition** of being a confident speaker waver slightly. Public speaking still made him nervous, despite interviews and press conferences in the city.

"You'll do great," Mrs. Peterson assured him, reading his anxiety. "Just be yourself. That's all they need—authenticity, not perfection."

At 10:30, she introduced him with **tender** words about the student he'd been: curious, determined, sometimes doubting but always willing to try. Alex took the stage, adjusting the microphone with hands that trembled slightly, and looked out at the sea of young faces.

"Thank you for that kind introduction, Mrs. Peterson," he began, giving a slight **bow** to acknowledge her kindness. "I have to admit, standing here feels surreal. Five years ago, I sat where you're sitting, wondering what came next, feeling both **excite**d and terrified about the future. I want to talk honestly with you today—not give you a **sack** of platitudes about following your dreams, but real talk about what it actually takes."

He clicked to his first slide—**footage** from his early reporting days, awkward interviews and stumbling questions. "This is me as a **rookie** journalist. Notice the **suspicious** expression on my interview subject's face? That's because I asked him the same question three times because I was too nervous to listen to his answers properly."

Laughter rippled through the audience, and Alex felt some tension **ease**. He continued, sharing stories of failure and growth, of assignments that went wrong and lessons learned from mistakes. He showed the **grid** of his investigation into housing corruption—the spreadsheets, the interviews, the slow accumulation of evidence.

"Journalism isn't glamorous most of the time," he explained. "It's sitting in a coffee **booth** for hours waiting for a source who might not show up. It's reading documents so boring they could be used as sleep aids. It's having your work questioned, criticized, sometimes attacked by people who find the truth **hostile** to their interests."

A hand shot up—a girl in the front row. "Did you ever want to quit?"

"Every week," Alex admitted. "Sometimes every day. The **shortage** of encouragement in the beginning was real. I worked long hours for little money, lived in an apartment so small you could **sail** paper airplanes from one end to the other without them hitting a wall. The building was in a dark **alley**, with **sodium** street lights that barely worked. My college **rival**—a guy who went into finance—bought a house before I could afford new furniture."

"So why didn't you quit?" another student called out.

"Because the work mattered more than the rewards," Alex said. "Because I'd **spring** awake at 3 AM with ideas for stories I needed to tell. Because on the days when I thought about giving up, I'd remember sitting in this very auditorium, listening to a journalist speak, and feeling my **ambition** ignite. Someone's story had lit that **bang** of possibility in me. I wanted to pass that forward."

He talked for forty-five minutes, **instruct**ing them not in formulas for success but in the **reliability** of hard work, the importance of **curiosity**, the necessity of resilience. He showed them his **diary** entries from his first year in the city—raw, honest accounts of homesickness and self-doubt alongside moments of triumph.

"These entries were **useless** to me at the time," he said. "Just venting, I thought. But later, I realized they documented my growth. They showed me that the person who felt **inadequate** in August was writing award-winning stories by May. Progress isn't always visible when you're in it."

When he opened the floor for questions, hands shot up immediately. A boy in a basketball jersey asked about balancing **ambition** with staying connected to home. A girl with artistic **doodles** on her **sack**—her backpack wanted to know if journalism was dying in the digital age. Another student asked whether you needed to move to a big city to make it in **publishing** or if there were other paths.

Alex answered each question thoughtfully, without the **denial** of difficulty but also without the **cruel** dismissal of possibility. Yes, journalism was changing. Yes, **coastal** cities offered more opportunities. Yes, leaving home was hard. But none of these challenges made success impossible—just **challenging**.

A quiet student in the back raised her hand tentatively. "What if we're not sure what we want to do? What if everyone else seems certain about their **ambition** but we're still figuring it out?"

"Then you're exactly where you should be," Alex said warmly. "The **speculation** that everyone else has it figured out is mostly an illusion. I've interviewed CEOs and senators and **worldwide** experts who admitted they still sometimes feel like they're faking it. Uncertainty isn't a **shortage** of potential—it's the **spring** from which **curiosity** flows. Keep exploring, keep trying, keep being open to possibilities."

After the formal talk ended, students crowded around with more questions. One girl showed him articles she'd written for the school paper, her work **challenging** local policies on student **transit** and parking. Alex offered genuine feedback, noting her strong voice and **added** suggestions for tightening her arguments.

"You're good," he told her. "Really good. Keep writing, keep questioning. The **reliability** of your research skills will **ease** you into any career path."

A boy asked about the technical aspects of investigative journalism—how to verify sources, how to **carve** out truth from **speculation**. Alex pulled up examples on his phone, showing him the **grid** he used to track information, the **disclosure** requirements for anonymous sources.

"It's **delicate** work," Alex explained. "You're balancing the public's right to know against individuals' privacy and safety. You're navigating ethical questions that don't always have clear answers. I once covered a story about a politician's **divorce** that revealed financial impropriety—I had to decide what was relevant to voters versus what was just personal. I heard someone **gasp** when I mentioned investigating both **secular** and religious institutions equally for corruption. But that's what makes it meaningful—treating all subjects with the same standards."

Mrs. Peterson eventually had to remind students about their next class, though many lingered. She walked with Alex back to the lobby, her expression proud and slightly emotional.

"You gave them something valuable today," she said. "Not a **sack** of empty inspiration, but honest **disclosure** about the realities and rewards of pursuing meaningful work. That talk had real **reliability**."

"I hope so," Alex said. "I kept thinking about what I would have wanted to hear at their age. Not that it would be easy, but that it would be worth it. Not that I wouldn't doubt myself, but that doubt doesn't mean failure."

They walked past the **barn**—actually the agriculture building that everyone called the barn—where the FFA students were working. Through the window, Alex could see kids tending plants and equipment, learning practical skills that would serve them whether they stayed in Riverside or ventured elsewhere.

"Can I ask you something?" Mrs. Peterson said. "You could be speaking at prestigious universities, getting paid **premium**—**substantial** fees. Why come back here to talk to high school students for free?"

Alex considered the question. "Because **sympathy** without action is **useless**. I've written articles about educational **inequality**—**shortage**, about students in rural communities being overlooked. But writing isn't enough. If I believe these students matter, I need to show up. Besides, this town shaped me. This school shaped me. You shaped me. Coming back isn't charity—it's **gratitude**."

Before leaving, Alex made a promise to stay in touch with several students interested in journalism. He gave them his email, encouraged them to send him their work, offered to connect them with internship opportunities when they were ready.

In the parking lot, he found his car had been decorated with **soap** messages on the windows: "Thanks Alex!" and "Riverside Pride!" The **comic** display made him smile—a **tender** gesture from students who probably had no idea how much their simple enthusiasm meant to him.

His phone buzzed with messages from city colleagues asking about his **spring** column plans and upcoming assignments. The pull of his professional life was constant, demanding. But standing in the Riverside High parking lot, Alex felt a different kind of pull—the **ambition** not for personal achievement but for meaningful contribution.

He thought about the quiet girl who'd asked about uncertainty, seeing in her question echoes of his younger self. He wanted to follow up with her specifically, make sure she knew that her uncertainty wasn't a **deficit**—wasn't **inappropriate** or wrong, but natural and even valuable.

Opening his **iPad**, he typed a note to Mrs. Peterson: "Would it be okay if I did this annually? Maybe set up a small scholarship fund for journalism students? I want to make this more than a one-time visit."

Her response came quickly: "Alex, that would be wonderful. The students **need**—would benefit from ongoing mentorship, not just celebrity visits. You're thinking like an educator, not just a successful alumnus. That's the difference that matters."

As Alex drove away from the school, past the familiar streets and buildings of his hometown, he felt something **crystallize**—**clarify**. Success wasn't just about what you achieved for yourself, but about what you enabled for others. The **worldwide** reach of his journalism mattered, but so did the **local** impact of mentoring students who might otherwise think their small-town origins limited their potential.

He stopped at a red light near the old **barn** where he'd attended the county fair as a kid, where he'd ridden horses and eaten **fried**—**excessive** amounts of fair food. Through his rearview mirror, he could see the high school in the distance, and he imagined those students continuing to their next classes, some of them carrying a **spark**—a **bang** of possibility that his visit might have ignited.

That spark wouldn't guarantee success. Some would face **hostile** environments in their chosen fields. Some would encounter **challenges**—**challenging** obstacles that might turn them back. But at least they'd know it was possible, that someone from Riverside had done it and believed they could too.

The light turned green, and Alex drove forward, already planning his next visit home. Not in two years this time, but in a few months. He'd make it a pattern, a **reliable** commitment. Because mentoring wasn't a one-time transaction—it was an ongoing relationship, a **cycle**—a **rolling** investment in the next generation.

His phone rang—Diana from the newsroom. He let it go to voicemail. Whatever the city needed could wait. Right now, he was still present in Riverside, still processing the **gift**—the **reward** of reconnection, still honoring the people and place that had made him who he was.

The **coastal** ambitions that had once driven him from this town hadn't disappeared, but they'd been **balanced**—been **supplemented** by something equally important: the understanding that giving back wasn't just noble, it was necessary. That the **ease** with which he could share his knowledge created an **obligation**—a responsibility to do so.

As he merged onto the highway back toward his parents' house, Alex thought about the **hormone**—the **rush**, the **adrenaline** of speaking to those students, of seeing their **curiosity** awaken, their **ambition** take shape. It was different from the rush of publishing a big story, but no less powerful.

The **speculation** he'd had about whether returning to Riverside would **diminish** his professional identity had proven completely wrong. If anything, it had **enhanced** it, **added** depth and purpose to his work. He wasn't just a journalist pursuing stories—he was someone committed to **facilitating**—to enabling the next generation of truth-tellers.

The **flood** of emails waiting in his inbox, the **grid** of deadlines and assignments ahead—all of it would get done. But first, he'd have dinner with his parents, walk through town once more, let Riverside **fill**—**complete** something in him that the city never quite could.

Because home wasn't **useless** nostalgia or **denial** of growth. It was the **foundation**—the **spring** from which everything else flowed. And like a **turtle** carrying its home on its back, Alex could move through the **worldwide** landscape of journalism while still carrying Riverside with him, letting it **ground**—**anchor** him even as he **sail**ed toward new horizons.

The mentoring wouldn't stop with today's talk. It was just beginning. And that **commitment**—that **reliability** of showing up, not just for glory but for guidance—felt like the truest success he'd achieved yet.
