## 📖 Reading Passage: Finding the Way

Marco was **lost** in the **forest**. He'd **taken** a **wrong** **turn** **somewhere** and now **couldn't** **find** his **way** **back**.

"**Somewhere** **around** **here** is the **trail**," he **thought**, **looking** **around**. But **everything** **looked** the **same**. He was truly **lost**.

He'd been **walking** for **hours**, **going** **somewhere** but **nowhere** **specific**. **Each** **direction** **looked** **like** it might **take** him **somewhere** **useful**, but he **wasn't** **sure** which **way** to **go**.

**Somewhere** in his **backpack** was a **map**, but in his **panic**, he **couldn't** **find** it. **Somewhere** in his **mind**, he **remembered** his **grandfather**'**s** **advice**: "When you're **lost**, **stop**. **Don't** **keep** **going** **somewhere** **without** **thinking**."

Marco **stopped**. He **took** a **deep** **breath**. **Being** **lost** **meant** he **didn't** **know** **where** he was. But **somewhere** **nearby** was the **path** **home**. He just **needed** to **think** **clearly**.

He **climbed** a **tall** **tree** to **look** **around**. From **up** **high**, he **could** **see** **somewhere** in the **distance** – **smoke** **rising** from the **village**. **That** was **where** he **needed** to **go**.

**Sometimes** **being** **lost** **helped** you **see** **where** you **really** **needed** to **be**. **Somewhere** along the **way**, Marco had **forgotten** to **pay** **attention**. But now, **seeing** the **village** **somewhere** **on** the **horizon**, he **knew** his **direction**.

He **climbed** **down** and **started** **walking** **toward** the **smoke**. **Somewhere** **inside**, he **felt** **relieved**. He **wasn't** **lost** **anymore** – he was **somewhere** **between** **lost** and **found**, **moving** **toward** **home**.

**Somewhere** along that **journey**, Marco **learned** an **important** **lesson**: **being** **lost** wasn't the **problem**. **Staying** **lost** **because** you **kept** **moving** **somewhere** **without** **thinking** – **that** was the **real** **problem**.

Two **hours** **later**, Marco **arrived** at the **village**. He'd been **lost**, had **wandered** **somewhere** **far** from the **path**, but had **found** his **way** **back**.

"Where **were** you?" his **mother** **asked**.

"**Somewhere** I **shouldn't** **have** **been**," Marco **smiled**. "But I **found** my **way** **back**."

**Being** **lost** **somewhere** **taught** him **how** to **find** **somewhere** **home**. And **that** was **worth** the **journey**.
